"I am dealing with Fever, Cough recently, and It's worrying me a bit.","The symptoms suggest Viral Infection, and the patient may be experiencing Common Cold.","Disease: FEVER
Treatment: Treatment
Routine use of antipyretics in low-grade fever is not justified. This may mask important clinical
indications. However, in acute febrile illnesses suggestive of viral or bacterial cause, fever
should be treated.
Non pharmacological treatment
Hydrotherapy and rest
Pharmacological treatment
Non-specific
 Tab. paracetamol 500-1000 mg 6-8 hourly. Or Tab. ibuprofen 400-600 mg 8 hourly.
Specific
 Antibiotics/antimalarials depending upon the cause suggested by clinical and laboratory
evaluation.
Outcome
In most cases of fever, patient may either recover spontaneously or a diagnosis is reached after
repeated clinical evaluation and investigations. If no diagnosis is reached in up to 3 weeks,
patient is said to be having fever of unknown origin (FUO) and should be managed accordingly.
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Avoid covering the patient having high fever with blanket etc.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in cool environment. Cold sponging of face and limbs
should bedone repeatedly.

Non-pharmacological treatment
 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."
"Lately, I've noticed symptoms like Sore Throat. It's been pretty uncomfortable.","These signs are commonly associated with Bacterial Infection, a condition that may result in Strep Throat.","Disease: MUMPS
Treatment: treatment
 Child should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. Water, decaffeinated soft drinks and
tea are better tolerated than acidic fruit juices (like orange juice, grape fruit juice or
lemonade) that make parotid pain worse.
 Either warm or cold packs - whichever feels better- may be used to sooth the swollen
parotid glands.
Pharmacological treatment
 Most cases are treated symptomatically on OPD basis.
 Fever treated using non aspirin fever medications such as paracetamol (10-15 mg/kg/day
SOS or every 4-6 hours). These medicines will also help relieve pain in the swollen
parotid glands. (caution: aspirin is contraindicated in children with viral illnesses due to
risk of Reye's syndrome).
 Being a viral illness, antibiotics have no role. There is no specific therapy available.
 Patients with abdominal pain, testicular swellings or signs of raised intracranial tension
need to be admitted in the hospital.
Patient education
 Parents should be explained warning signs e.g. in boys, parents are told to watch for high
fever, with pain and swelling of the testicles.
392
Pediatric Conditions
 Watch for abdominal pain that can mean involvement of the pancreas in either sex, or
involvement of the ovaries in girls.
 Severe headache, stiff neck, convulsions (seizures), extreme drowsiness etc suggest CNS
involvement and need for admission to a tertiary level center.
 Recurrence of high grade fever (above 101°F/38.3°C) often heralds onset of the above
complication and can be used as an early"

 Exposure to warm environment may be suggested
 Non weight bearing exercises
 Surgery in severely damaged joints
Pharmacological treatment
 Acute stage of illness
 Treat symptomatically (Tab. paracetamol 1 gm 3-4 times a day for fever, headache and
pain.)
 Avoid aspirin and steroid because of risk of GI side effects and Reye’s syndrome with
aspirin.
 Tab. hydroxychloroquinine 200mg orally once daily or Tab. chloroquinine phosphate
300mg per day for a period of 4 weeks in cases where arthralgia is refractory to other
drugs.
 Sideeffects of hydroxychloroquinine include retinal damage andelevated liver enzymes.

prompt diagnosis and rapid supplementation of appropriate therapy.
Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

Emergency Conditions
Salient features
Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa
 Flushing, itching, urticaria (hives), angioedema, morbilliform rash, piloerection
 Periorbital itching, erythema and edema, conjunctival erythema, tearing
 Itching of lips, tongue, palate, and external auditory canals; and swelling of lips, tongue,
and uvula
 Itching of genitalia, palms, and soles
Respiratory

wheezing/bronchospasm, decreased peak expiratory flow
 Cyanosis, respiratory arrest
Gastrointestinal
 Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (stringy mucus), diarrhea, dysphagia
Cardiovascular system
 Chest pain
 Tachycardia, bradycardia (less common), other arrhythmias, palpitations
 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

"I started feeling Abdominal Pain, Bloating, and it doesn't seem to be improving.","These signs are commonly associated with Poor Diet, a condition that may result in Indigestion.","Disease: CONSTIPATION
Treatment: treatment. The important secondary causes
may include neurological, hormonal, colonic, malignancy, depression. Secondary causes
should be looked for in case of recent onset or constipation of severe symptoms.
Salient features
 Constipation is defined as decrease in frequency and liquidity of stool compared to the
normal pattern in a particular individual.
 Important complaints suggesting constipation include straining at defaecation >25% of
time, lumpy/hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, or less than 3 bowel
actions per week.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Reassurance-since many patients with normal stools and in pregnancy, imagine that they
are constipated.
 High fiber diet and increased intake of fluid with decrease in consumption of caffeinated
drinks.
 Retraining of bowels (avoiding suppression of urge to defecate, making a regular habit).
 Bulk forming agents like 'isapghula husk' or 'psyllium seeds' also help to relieve mild
constipation.
 Regular physical exercise such as walk for 1/2 to 1 hour daily and abdominal exercises.
Pharmacological treatment
(Usually required for moderate to severe constipation).
 Lactulose Soln 15-20 ml orally at night. Or Susp. magnesium sulphate 15-20 ml at night.
Or Tab. sodium picosulphate 10 mg at night. Or
135
Gastrointestinal Diseases
 Isotonic polyethylene glycol (PEG) electrolyte solution 125-250 ml.
 Any of these may be given 2-4 times a week. Some patients may require treatment for
several weeks or months if there is no improvement.
 Tab. mosapride 5 mg 2 or 3 times a day. In some patients may be required for several
weeks.
 Phosphate enemas to be used on as and when required basis in patients having acute
problem with severe constipation or sub-acute intestinal obstruction."
"I am dealing with Fatigue, Sadness recently, and It's worrying me a bit.","This presentation aligns with Depression, often seen in cases of Major Depressive.","Disease: MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER
Treatment: treatment
 Psychological factors are very important in the causing, maintaining as well as
improving depression. For holistic management of depression, some form of
psychotherapy should be co-administered.
288
Psychiatry Disorders
 Psychodynamic approach aims at promoting personality change through understanding of
major conflicts, achieving insight into defenses, ego distortions, providing role model
permitting cathartic relief or aggression.
 Cognitive behavioral approach aims at providing symptomatic relief through alteration of
target thoughts, identifying cognitive distortions, modifying erroneous assumptions,
promoting self control over thinking patterns.
 Interpersonal approach aims at providing symptoms relief through solving current
interpersonal problems, reducing stress involving family and work, improving
interpersonal communication skills.
Supportive approach with techniques such as catharsis, realistic problem solving is also
useful.
Pharmacological treatment
 Hospitalization is needed in severely suicidal patients, treatment resistant cases and non
compliant patients.
 SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are currently the drug of choice for
depression.
- Tab. fluoxetine - start with 20 mg/day increase to 40 mg/day, if no response in 4-6
weeks
- Tab. escitalopram - start with 10 mg/day depending on tolerability and gradually
increase upto 30mg/day
- Tab. sertraline - start with 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day depending on the severity of
symptoms in 1 HS dosage preferably and gradually increase to maximum of
300mg/day
 Tab. mirtazepine - start with 7.5 mg/day and gradually increase upto maximum 30
mg/day.
 Tricyclic antidepressants like Tab. imipramine for depression with somatic complaints.
Start with 25mg twice a day and gradually increase by 25 mg/day to maximum of 300
mg/day if no response (should be avoided in patients with heart disease, glaucoma,
benign prostatic enlargement and epilepsy).
 Antidepressant action takes about 2-3 weeks and needs to be continued for 6-9 months in
first episode and for longer period in recurrent depression.
 Initially benzodiazepines may need to be co-administered to manage insomnia and
anxiety.
 In cases of bipolar depression, there might be a sudden switch to mania in which case
anti-depressant should be withdrawn.
 ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is a very safe, effective and economical mode of
treatment and is indicated in severe depression with or without suicidal ideas, retarded
depression and resistant depression.

Psychiatry Disorders
Patient education
 Explain the nature of illness, consequences of untreated depression, suicidal risk, need for
adequate does for adequate duration and other supportive measures.
 The therapeutic response takes time to appear but side effects may appear earlier.
Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants are dry mouth, constipation, postural
hypotension (giddiness), blurred vision, sweating, palpitation, tremors, delayed
micturition, sedation, etc.
 Common side effects of fluoxetine are agitation, headache, nausea or heartburn, tremors,
changes in sexual performance, blurred vision, dry mouth and loss of appetite."

Treatment: treatment
These medications should be reserved for short-term control of active vertigo. They are less
helpful for chronic dizziness and may hinder central compensation.
 Antihistamines like Tab. meclizine (25–50 mg 3 times daily), Tab. dimenhydrinate (50
mg 1–2 times daily) and Tab. promethazine (25 mg 2–3 times daily, also can be given
rectally and IM)
 Benzodiazepines like Tab. diazepam (2.5 mg 1–3 times daily) and Tab. clonazepam (0.25
mg 1 –3 times daily.
 Anticholinergic agents like scopolamine transdermal patch (for motion sickness only)
 Physical therapylike repositioningmanoeuvres (for BPPV)
 Diuretics and/or low-sodium (1 g/d) diet (for Ménière's disease)
 Antimigrainous drugs (for vestibular migraine)
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for psychosomatic vertigo)
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
 A common cause of recurrent vertigo
 Episodes are brief (less than 1 min and typically 15–20 s)
 Always provoked by changes in head position relative to gravity, such as lying down,
rolling over in bed, rising from a supine position, and extending the head to look upward.
 With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally
 Horizontal canal BPPV resulting in a horizontal nystagmus
 Superior (also called anterior) canal involvement is rare.
 BPPV is treated with repositioning maneuvers that utilize gravity to remove the otoconia
from the semicircular canal.
 For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is the most commonly used procedure.
Vestibular Migraine
 Usually part of migraine aura but can occur independently. The duration of vertigo may
be from minutes to hours. Vestibular migraine typically is treated with medications that
are used for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
 Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the time of an attack.(See vomiting
section)
Ménière's Disease
 Attack consists of vertigo, hearing loss, & pain, pressure or fullness in affected ear.
 Diuretics and sodium restriction are the initial treatments.
 If attacks persist, injections of gentamicin into the middle ear or full ablative procedures
are required.
 Tab. betahistine 24-48 mg/day relieves pressure from excess fluid. Initial dose 16 mg

 Dizziness may be a somatic manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as major
depression, anxiety, or panic disorder.
 Thus, treatment with antianxiety medications and cognitive/behavioral therapy may be
helpful.

Salient features
 Precipitating allergens are dust, pollen, fish, nuts, strawberries, cold air, tobacco smoke,
viral and bacterial infections, exercise, emotional stress and drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin,
beta-blocker
 Classical symptoms include cough, breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing. Signs
include tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles, silent chest
Diagnosis
 When asthma is suspected and other disorders have been ruled out (e.g. tumours in adults,
foreign body in children; don’t assume the presence of wheeze means asthma), confirm
the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
 PFTs suffice as objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:
A 12 % or greater improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in children and
adults, and > 200 ml in adults from the baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled
-
short-acting beta2 agonist.
Serial measures of peak expiratory flow (PEF): A > 20% change after administration
of a bronchodilator.
-
 When there is some probability of asthma and the above tests are non-diagnostic, the
following tests may be used to help diagnosis of asthma:
Methacholine challenge
Exercise challenge
-
Inhaled corticosteroid trial: appropriate doses of inhaled steroids for 4-6 weeks
-
Raised value of absolute eosinophil count (>6-8%)
-
Non pharmacological treatment
-
 Evaluate and assess impact and exposure to allergens and irritants in individual patients.
 Complete cessation of smoking and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is
strongly recommended.
 Lifestyle management-"

Eye Diseases
 Counselling regarding the syndrome and work environment modification
Steps for relieving computer eye strain
- Get a computerized eye exam before start using computer. Repeat once a year.
- Use proper lighting. Eliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce
interior lightingby using lower intensity bulbs and tubes.
- Minimize glare: To install an anti-glare screen on your monitor. Paint bright white walls a
darker color with a matt finish.
- Upgrade your display. Use LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.
- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen.
- Blink more often.
- Exercise your eyes: Follow 20-20-20 rule i.e. after every 20 minutes, look at 20 feet
distance for 20 seconds.
- Take frequent breaks - two 15-minute breaks -four additional five-minute ""minibreaks""
throughout the work day (6-8 hrs).
- Modify your workstation. Proper posture during computer work. Position computer
screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15
degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from
the operator.
- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen. Anti-
reflective coating in the lenses should be used and avoid contact lens use during computer
work.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tear substitute should be considered if symptoms are aggravated during computer work.
Commercially available tear substitutes include sodium carboxymethylcellulose and
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

Non-pharmacological treatment
 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."
"Lately, I've noticed symptoms like Joint Pain, Swelling. It's been pretty uncomfortable.","Clinically, this pattern points toward Autoimmune Response, indicating a probable diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis.","Disease: ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Treatment: treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips
tilted forward is probably the best.

 After period of exclusive breastfeeding (6 months), cereal based diet should be added.
Encourage green leafy vegetables and fruits.
 Treatment depends on hemoglobin levels and age of the patients
Pharmacological treatment-Oral Iron Therapy
 Oral ferrous salts (sulphate, gluconate etc) are the preferred therapeutic iron preparations.
 Therapeutic iron dose: 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 2 – 3 divided doses to be given
between meals for 2 months after normal Hb concentration for age is achieved.
 In prematurity start iron syrup from 2nd week of life to 1 year.
 Response to therapy – decreased irritability and improved appetite is seen within 12 – 24
hours. Rise in Hb levels seen within 7 days at the rate of 0.25 –0.4 g/dl/day.
373
Pediatric Conditions
 If the response is inadequate, check for the prescribed dose, compliance, presence of
diarrhoea or malnutrition, infections or β thalas semia trait mistakenly diagnosed as iron
deficiency anaemia.
Parenteral Iron Therapy
 It is rarely required. However, when oral iron is not tolerated, severe ADRs to oral iron or
presence of malabsorption syndromes, parenteral iron therapy may be used.
 Total dose of iron is: Iron(mg) = wt(kg) x Hb deficit (g/dl) x 4
 Injection iron dextran or iron sorbitol citrate (50 mg/ml) deep gluteal IM injection is
preferred.
Blood Transfusion
 When Hb is less than 3g% or Hb 4-6 g% in cardiac compromised patient
 PCV 15 ml/kg at rate of 4-5 ml/kg/hour
Patient/ parent education
 Iron deficiency anaemia occurs generally due to dietary deficiency of iron. Once the diet is
modified, the patient should stick to that diet.
 Iron should be taken between meals and never with tea or milk
 Intake of iron usually causes harmless black discolouration of teeth and stools. The teeth
discolouration can be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after doses."
"I've been experiencing Anxiety, Rapid Heartbeat, and it's starting to affect my daily activities.","These signs are commonly associated with Stress, a condition that may result in Panic Disorder.","Disease: FETAL DISTRESS IN LABOR
Treatment: management
 If a maternal cause is identified (e.g. maternal fever, drugs), initiate appropriate
management.
 If a maternal cause is not identified and the fetal heart rate remains abnormal throughout
at least three contractions, perform a vaginal examination to check for explanatory signs
of distress:
 If there is bleedingwith intermittent or constant pain, suspect abruptio placentae.
 If there are signs of infection (fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge) give antibiotics as
for amnionitis.
 A normal fetal heart rate may slow during a contraction but usually recovers to normal as
soon as the uterus relaxes.
 A very slow fetal heart rate in the absence of contractions or persisting after contractions
is suggestive of fetal distress.
 A rapid fetal heart rate may be a response to maternal fever, drugs causing rapid maternal
heart rate (e.g. terbutaline or ritodrine), hypertension or amnionitis. In the absence of a
rapid maternal heart rate, a rapid fetal heart rate should be considered a sign of fetal
distress.
 If thecord is below the presenting part or in the vagina, manage as prolapsed cord .
 If fetal heart rate abnormalities persist or there are additional signs of distress (thick
meconium-stained fluid), plan delivery:
 If the cervix is fully dilated and the fetal head is not more than 1/5 above the symphysis
pubis or the leading bony edge of the fetal head is at 0 station, deliver by vacuum

 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

Treatment: Treatment
Routine use of antipyretics in low-grade fever is not justified. This may mask important clinical
indications. However, in acute febrile illnesses suggestive of viral or bacterial cause, fever
should be treated.
Non pharmacological treatment

Pharmacological treatment
Non-specific
 Tab. paracetamol 500-1000 mg 6-8 hourly. Or Tab. ibuprofen 400-600 mg 8 hourly.
Specific
 Antibiotics/antimalarials depending upon the cause suggested by clinical and laboratory
evaluation.
Outcome
In most cases of fever, patient may either recover spontaneously or a diagnosis is reached after
repeated clinical evaluation and investigations. If no diagnosis is reached in up to 3 weeks,
patient is said to be having fever of unknown origin (FUO) and should be managed accordingly.
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Avoid covering the patient having high fever with blanket etc.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in cool environment. Cold sponging of face and limbs

"I started feeling Dizziness, Fatigue, and it doesn't seem to be improving.","The symptoms suggest Dehydration, and the patient may be experiencing Heat Exhaustion.","Disease: STROKE
Treatment: treatment
 Rapid evaluation is necessary for the use of time sensitive treatments such as
thrombolysis. Close attention is paid to the ABC’s i.e. Airway, Breathing and Circulation
of the patient and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Once the diagnosis
of stroke is made, a brain imaging study is necessary to determine if the cause of stroke is
ischemia or hemorrhage. CT is useful in identifying early hemorrhage while MRI is
useful in identifying early infarct.
 Blood pressure should be lowered if there is malignant hypertension or concomitant
myocardial ischemia or if blood pressure is >185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic therapy is
anticipated (See section of hypertension)
 Fever is treated with antipyretics and surface cooling.
 Euglycemia is to be maintained.
 Between 5 and 10% of patients develop enough cerebral edema to cause herniation. Other
anti-edema measures such as head elevation, Tab. furosemide 40 mg OD and
hyperventilation are useful.
 Common complications of bedridden patients—infections (pneumonia, urinary, and skin)
and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolism are to be prevented.
 Intravenous thrombolysis (Table 1):
 Tab. aspirin 75 mg OD
 Inj. heparin 5000 IU SC
 Proper rehabilitation of the stroke patient includes early physical, occupational, and
speech therapy.
Secondary prevention of stroke and TIA
 Control of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation.
 Tab.aspirin 75-325 mg/day is recommended for stroke prevention.
 Tab. warfarin is useful for stroke prevention with a target INR of 2-3 in patients with
chronic nonvalvular AF as well as untreated rheumatic heart disease with AF.

Treatment of haemorrhagic stroke
 Inj. mannitol 20% 1g/kg stat followed by 0.5 g/kg IV infusion, Inj. furosemide 40 mg IV
stat, elevation of head end and hyperventilation are useful.
 Antihypertensive agents are instituted if BP is more than 180mmHg systolic or
>130mmHg diastolic. Goal is to keep a mean arterial pressure of less than 130mmHg.
 With thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/µl), transfusion of fresh platelets
is indicated.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
The goals ofprophylactic administrationof antibioticsto surgical patients are to:
 Reduce the incidence of surgical site infection;

Surgery
 Use antibiotics in a manner that is supported by evidence of effectiveness; minimize the
effect of antibiotics on the patient's normal bacterial flora; adverse effects.
Prophylaxis is uniformly recommended for all clean-contaminated, contaminated and
dirty procedures. It is considered optional for most clean procedures, although it may be
indicated for certain patients and clean procedures that fulfill specific risk criteria. It is
important to emphasize that surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an adjunct to, not a
substitute for goodsurgical technique.
 Antibiotics prophylaxis should be regarded as one component of an effective policy for
the control of hospital acquired infection in procedure that requires the insertion of
implants or prosthetic devices, the term. Surgical site infection is used to encompass the
surgical wound and the implant. Surgical site infection also encompasses infections
involving the body cavity (e.g. subphrenic abscess), bones, joints, meninges and other
tissues involved in the operation. Throughout this guideline the term surgical site
infection (SSl) is used, unless the evidence relates specifically to surgical wound
infection."

Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

 Counselling regarding the syndrome and work environment modification
Steps for relieving computer eye strain
- Get a computerized eye exam before start using computer. Repeat once a year.
- Use proper lighting. Eliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce
interior lightingby using lower intensity bulbs and tubes.
- Minimize glare: To install an anti-glare screen on your monitor. Paint bright white walls a
darker color with a matt finish.
- Upgrade your display. Use LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.
- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen.
- Blink more often.
- Exercise your eyes: Follow 20-20-20 rule i.e. after every 20 minutes, look at 20 feet
distance for 20 seconds.
- Take frequent breaks - two 15-minute breaks -four additional five-minute ""minibreaks""
throughout the work day (6-8 hrs).
- Modify your workstation. Proper posture during computer work. Position computer
screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15
degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from
the operator.
- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen. Anti-
reflective coating in the lenses should be used and avoid contact lens use during computer
work.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tear substitute should be considered if symptoms are aggravated during computer work.
Commercially available tear substitutes include sodium carboxymethylcellulose and
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."
"I've been experiencing Back Pain, Numbness, and it's starting to affect my daily activities.","The symptoms suggest Sciatica, and the patient may be experiencing Herniated Disc.","Disease: CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS
Treatment: treatment
 In acute painful situation rest, moist heat in cold weather and light massage (improves
tone, circulation and elasticity) to paraspinal muscles. Cervical traction in the position of
maximum comfort to neck (5-10 pounds) for 10-15 minutes. Ultrasonic exposure on
painful trigger points in cervical and shoulder muscles. Inter ferential therapy (IFT) for
acute neck and back pain. Removable soft cervical collar/back corset/ back belt for
symptomatic relief.
(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips

Treatment: treatment.
Salient features
 Precipitating allergens are dust, pollen, fish, nuts, strawberries, cold air, tobacco smoke,
viral and bacterial infections, exercise, emotional stress and drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin,
beta-blocker
 Classical symptoms include cough, breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing. Signs
include tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles, silent chest
Diagnosis
 When asthma is suspected and other disorders have been ruled out (e.g. tumours in adults,
foreign body in children; don’t assume the presence of wheeze means asthma), confirm
the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
 PFTs suffice as objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:
A 12 % or greater improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in children and
adults, and > 200 ml in adults from the baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled
-
short-acting beta2 agonist.
Serial measures of peak expiratory flow (PEF): A > 20% change after administration
of a bronchodilator.
-
 When there is some probability of asthma and the above tests are non-diagnostic, the
following tests may be used to help diagnosis of asthma:
Methacholine challenge
Exercise challenge
-
Inhaled corticosteroid trial: appropriate doses of inhaled steroids for 4-6 weeks
-
Raised value of absolute eosinophil count (>6-8%)
-
Non pharmacological treatment
-
 Evaluate and assess impact and exposure to allergens and irritants in individual patients.
 Complete cessation of smoking and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is
strongly recommended.
 Lifestyle management-"
"These past few days, Joint Pain, Swelling have been bothering me.","The symptoms suggest Rheumatoid Arthritis, and the patient may be experiencing Arthritis.","Disease: ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Treatment: treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

Treatment: treatment
These medications should be reserved for short-term control of active vertigo. They are less
helpful for chronic dizziness and may hinder central compensation.
 Antihistamines like Tab. meclizine (25–50 mg 3 times daily), Tab. dimenhydrinate (50
mg 1–2 times daily) and Tab. promethazine (25 mg 2–3 times daily, also can be given
rectally and IM)
 Benzodiazepines like Tab. diazepam (2.5 mg 1–3 times daily) and Tab. clonazepam (0.25
mg 1 –3 times daily.
 Anticholinergic agents like scopolamine transdermal patch (for motion sickness only)
 Physical therapylike repositioningmanoeuvres (for BPPV)
 Diuretics and/or low-sodium (1 g/d) diet (for Ménière's disease)
 Antimigrainous drugs (for vestibular migraine)
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for psychosomatic vertigo)
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
 A common cause of recurrent vertigo
 Episodes are brief (less than 1 min and typically 15–20 s)
 Always provoked by changes in head position relative to gravity, such as lying down,
rolling over in bed, rising from a supine position, and extending the head to look upward.
 With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally
 Horizontal canal BPPV resulting in a horizontal nystagmus
 Superior (also called anterior) canal involvement is rare.
 BPPV is treated with repositioning maneuvers that utilize gravity to remove the otoconia
from the semicircular canal.
 For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is the most commonly used procedure.
Vestibular Migraine
 Usually part of migraine aura but can occur independently. The duration of vertigo may
be from minutes to hours. Vestibular migraine typically is treated with medications that
are used for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
 Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the time of an attack.(See vomiting
section)
Ménière's Disease
 Attack consists of vertigo, hearing loss, & pain, pressure or fullness in affected ear.
 Diuretics and sodium restriction are the initial treatments.
 If attacks persist, injections of gentamicin into the middle ear or full ablative procedures
are required.
 Tab. betahistine 24-48 mg/day relieves pressure from excess fluid. Initial dose 16 mg
TDS initially with maintenance.

Central Nervous System Diseases
Psychosomatic Dizziness/vertigo
 Important role in chronic dizziness
 Dizziness may be a somatic manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as major
depression, anxiety, or panic disorder.
 Thus, treatment with antianxiety medications and cognitive/behavioral therapy may be
helpful.

Treatment: treatment
 Since the etiology of RA is unknown, therapy remains empirical and palliative, aimed at
relieving the signs and symptoms of the disease.
 In acute pain rest and splint. Otherwise exercises directed at maintaining muscle strength
and joint mobility without exacerbating joint inflammation. A variety of orthotic (splints)
and assistive devices (cane, walker) can be helpful in supporting and aligning deformed
joints to reduce pain and improve function.
Pharmacological treatment
 In acute inflammation any of the NSAIDs as given in section on osteoarthritis may be
given except paracetamol. The anti-inflammatory action of the NSAIDs may take 2-4
weeks to become evident. Evaluation of persistent polyarthritis.
 Reduced NSAID dosages have to be used in the elderly and in patients with impaired
renal function. Concomitant use of more than one NSAID only increases toxicity, and has
no additional benefit. Patient not responding to one NSAID may still show a good
response to another.
 Topical applications-containing salicylates, capsaicin, nicotinates, menthol, camphor and

Non-pharmacological treatment
 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."

Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

should be looked for in case of recent onset or constipation of severe symptoms.
Salient features
 Constipation is defined as decrease in frequency and liquidity of stool compared to the
normal pattern in a particular individual.
 Important complaints suggesting constipation include straining at defaecation >25% of
time, lumpy/hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, or less than 3 bowel
actions per week.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Reassurance-since many patients with normal stools and in pregnancy, imagine that they
are constipated.
 High fiber diet and increased intake of fluid with decrease in consumption of caffeinated
drinks.
 Retraining of bowels (avoiding suppression of urge to defecate, making a regular habit).
 Bulk forming agents like 'isapghula husk' or 'psyllium seeds' also help to relieve mild
constipation.
 Regular physical exercise such as walk for 1/2 to 1 hour daily and abdominal exercises.
Pharmacological treatment
(Usually required for moderate to severe constipation).

Treatment: treatment
 After period of exclusive breastfeeding (6 months), cereal based diet should be added.
Encourage green leafy vegetables and fruits.
 Treatment depends on hemoglobin levels and age of the patients
Pharmacological treatment-Oral Iron Therapy
 Oral ferrous salts (sulphate, gluconate etc) are the preferred therapeutic iron preparations.
 Therapeutic iron dose: 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 2 – 3 divided doses to be given
between meals for 2 months after normal Hb concentration for age is achieved.
 In prematurity start iron syrup from 2nd week of life to 1 year.
 Response to therapy – decreased irritability and improved appetite is seen within 12 – 24
hours. Rise in Hb levels seen within 7 days at the rate of 0.25 –0.4 g/dl/day.
373
Pediatric Conditions
 If the response is inadequate, check for the prescribed dose, compliance, presence of
diarrhoea or malnutrition, infections or β thalas semia trait mistakenly diagnosed as iron
deficiency anaemia.
Parenteral Iron Therapy
 It is rarely required. However, when oral iron is not tolerated, severe ADRs to oral iron or
presence of malabsorption syndromes, parenteral iron therapy may be used.
 Total dose of iron is: Iron(mg) = wt(kg) x Hb deficit (g/dl) x 4
 Injection iron dextran or iron sorbitol citrate (50 mg/ml) deep gluteal IM injection is
preferred.
Blood Transfusion
 When Hb is less than 3g% or Hb 4-6 g% in cardiac compromised patient
 PCV 15 ml/kg at rate of 4-5 ml/kg/hour
Patient/ parent education
 Iron deficiency anaemia occurs generally due to dietary deficiency of iron. Once the diet is
modified, the patient should stick to that diet.
 Iron should be taken between meals and never with tea or milk
 Intake of iron usually causes harmless black discolouration of teeth and stools. The teeth
discolouration can be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after doses."

Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

Treatment: treatment
 Rapid evaluation is necessary for the use of time sensitive treatments such as
thrombolysis. Close attention is paid to the ABC’s i.e. Airway, Breathing and Circulation
of the patient and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Once the diagnosis
of stroke is made, a brain imaging study is necessary to determine if the cause of stroke is
ischemia or hemorrhage. CT is useful in identifying early hemorrhage while MRI is
useful in identifying early infarct.
 Blood pressure should be lowered if there is malignant hypertension or concomitant
myocardial ischemia or if blood pressure is >185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic therapy is
anticipated (See section of hypertension)
 Fever is treated with antipyretics and surface cooling.
 Euglycemia is to be maintained.
 Between 5 and 10% of patients develop enough cerebral edema to cause herniation. Other
anti-edema measures such as head elevation, Tab. furosemide 40 mg OD and
hyperventilation are useful.
 Common complications of bedridden patients—infections (pneumonia, urinary, and skin)
and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolism are to be prevented.
 Intravenous thrombolysis (Table 1):
 Tab. aspirin 75 mg OD
 Inj. heparin 5000 IU SC
 Proper rehabilitation of the stroke patient includes early physical, occupational, and
speech therapy.
Secondary prevention of stroke and TIA
 Control of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation.
 Tab.aspirin 75-325 mg/day is recommended for stroke prevention.
 Tab. warfarin is useful for stroke prevention with a target INR of 2-3 in patients with
chronic nonvalvular AF as well as untreated rheumatic heart disease with AF.

 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat

Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.

"Lately, I've noticed symptoms like e Itching, Redness. It's been pretty uncomfortable.","These signs are commonly associated with Allergies, a condition that may result in Allergic Reaction.","Disease: ANAPHYLAXIS
Treatment: treatment depends on
prompt diagnosis and rapid supplementation of appropriate therapy.
Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline
52
Emergency Conditions
Salient features
Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa
 Flushing, itching, urticaria (hives), angioedema, morbilliform rash, piloerection
 Periorbital itching, erythema and edema, conjunctival erythema, tearing
 Itching of lips, tongue, palate, and external auditory canals; and swelling of lips, tongue,
and uvula
 Itching of genitalia, palms, and soles
Respiratory
 Nasal itching, congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing
 Throat itching and tightness, dysphonia, hoarseness, stridor, dry staccato cough
 Lower airways: increased respiratory rate, shortness of breath, chest tightness, deep cough,
wheezing/bronchospasm, decreased peak expiratory flow
 Cyanosis, respiratory arrest
Gastrointestinal
 Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (stringy mucus), diarrhea, dysphagia
Cardiovascular system
 Chest pain
 Tachycardia, bradycardia (less common), other arrhythmias, palpitations
 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

Treatment: treatment
 In acute painful situation rest, moist heat in cold weather and light massage (improves
tone, circulation and elasticity) to paraspinal muscles. Cervical traction in the position of
maximum comfort to neck (5-10 pounds) for 10-15 minutes. Ultrasonic exposure on
painful trigger points in cervical and shoulder muscles. Inter ferential therapy (IFT) for
acute neck and back pain. Removable soft cervical collar/back corset/ back belt for
symptomatic relief.
(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips
tilted forward is probably the best.

 Emotional symptoms include emotional hypersensitivity, depression, irritability,
mood swings, anxiety, tension, fear of loss of control and confusion.
 Diagnosis is confirmed by excluding the concomitant medical or psychiatric
disorders with which it may be confused (depending on the symptoms).
Non- pharmacological treatment
Life-style advice should be offered to all women as first line of treatment.
1. Daily charting of symptoms for two months.
2. Dietary modifications like: increase complex carbohydrate meals, reduce or eliminate,
especially in the luteal phase - salts, chocolate, caffeine and alcohol; and several small
meals per day.
3. Moderate regular aerobic exercise like brisk walk 1-2 miles per day for 4-5days/week.
4. Stress management courses/counseling.
Pharmacological treatment
1. Tab. pyridoxine 100 mg/day for 10-14 days (during luteal phase) (maximum daily dose is
150 mg) or Tab. Evening primrose oil 500 mg 3 times a day.
2. NSAIDs like mefenamic acid 500 mg 3 times a day for premenstrual dysmenorrhea.
3. In case of predominantly physical symptoms (bloatedness, irritability swelling,
270

weight gain, breast tenderness), Tab. spironolactone 100 mg/day Or Tab. bromocriptine
1.25 - 5 mg/day in the luteal phase for mastalgia. (Common side effects are nausea and
vomiting. Tablet can be given vaginally if side effects are very severe.)
4. If no relief in symptoms with above measures in 2 - 3 cycles and symptoms are
predominantly emotional, then the following drugs are used preferably in consultation
with a psychiatrist: Tab. fluoxetine 5-20 mg/day
5. In non-responders to the above therapy, ovulation suppression may be beneficial; any
of the following can be used: Low dose combined oral contraceptive pills, 1 pill daily
from 5th to 25th day of the cycle."
"I am dealing with e Joint Pain, Swelling recently, and It's worrying me a bit.","Based on the symptoms, the likely cause is Rheumatoid Arthrit, which typically leads to is  Arthritis.","Disease: ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Treatment: treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

Treatment: treatment
These medications should be reserved for short-term control of active vertigo. They are less
helpful for chronic dizziness and may hinder central compensation.
 Antihistamines like Tab. meclizine (25–50 mg 3 times daily), Tab. dimenhydrinate (50
mg 1–2 times daily) and Tab. promethazine (25 mg 2–3 times daily, also can be given
rectally and IM)
 Benzodiazepines like Tab. diazepam (2.5 mg 1–3 times daily) and Tab. clonazepam (0.25
mg 1 –3 times daily.
 Anticholinergic agents like scopolamine transdermal patch (for motion sickness only)
 Physical therapylike repositioningmanoeuvres (for BPPV)
 Diuretics and/or low-sodium (1 g/d) diet (for Ménière's disease)
 Antimigrainous drugs (for vestibular migraine)
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for psychosomatic vertigo)
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
 A common cause of recurrent vertigo
 Episodes are brief (less than 1 min and typically 15–20 s)
 Always provoked by changes in head position relative to gravity, such as lying down,
rolling over in bed, rising from a supine position, and extending the head to look upward.
 With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally
 Horizontal canal BPPV resulting in a horizontal nystagmus
 Superior (also called anterior) canal involvement is rare.
 BPPV is treated with repositioning maneuvers that utilize gravity to remove the otoconia
from the semicircular canal.
 For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is the most commonly used procedure.
Vestibular Migraine
 Usually part of migraine aura but can occur independently. The duration of vertigo may
be from minutes to hours. Vestibular migraine typically is treated with medications that
are used for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
 Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the time of an attack.(See vomiting
section)
Ménière's Disease
 Attack consists of vertigo, hearing loss, & pain, pressure or fullness in affected ear.
 Diuretics and sodium restriction are the initial treatments.
 If attacks persist, injections of gentamicin into the middle ear or full ablative procedures
are required.
 Tab. betahistine 24-48 mg/day relieves pressure from excess fluid. Initial dose 16 mg

Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

Emergency Conditions
Salient features
Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa
 Flushing, itching, urticaria (hives), angioedema, morbilliform rash, piloerection
 Periorbital itching, erythema and edema, conjunctival erythema, tearing
 Itching of lips, tongue, palate, and external auditory canals; and swelling of lips, tongue,
and uvula
 Itching of genitalia, palms, and soles
Respiratory
 Nasal itching, congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing
 Throat itching and tightness, dysphonia, hoarseness, stridor, dry staccato cough
 Lower airways: increased respiratory rate, shortness of breath, chest tightness, deep cough,
wheezing/bronchospasm, decreased peak expiratory flow
 Cyanosis, respiratory arrest
Gastrointestinal
 Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (stringy mucus), diarrhea, dysphagia
Cardiovascular system
 Chest pain
 Tachycardia, bradycardia (less common), other arrhythmias, palpitations
 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.
Patient education

"I started feeling e Nausea, Vomiting, and it doesn't seem to be improving.","The symptoms suggest Food Poisoning, and the patient may be experiencing Gastroenteritis.","Disease: VOMITING
Treatment: treatment
 Hospitalize the patient to give intravenous fluids in case of dehydration. Start oral fluids
as soon as the patient can tolerate. Appropriate analgesics if patient has severe pain.
 Acute vomiting : Rule out gastric outlet obstruction then Inj. odansetron 8 mg IV repeat 8
hourly if needed or Inj. metoclopramide 10 mg IM, repeat after 6 hours if needed or Tab.
domperidone 10 mg three times a dayor Tab. metoclopramide 10 mg three times a day
 In pregnancy avoid all drugs, if possible. Tab. promethazine 25 mg oral/injection is safe
in the first trimester
 If there is history of motion sickness then give Tab. cyclizine 50 mg 3 times daily.
Patient education
 Avoid stale food, cut vegetables, fruits kept in open, drink potable water only.
 Avoid NSAIDS, especially if ulcer symptoms are present.
 Prevent dehydration: Encourage patients to take sips of liquids at short intervals to
prevent dehydration.
 Endoscopy is necessary, if symptom persists.
 Prevent motion sickness by avoiding heavy meal before travel."
"Lately, I've noticed symptoms like e Back Pain, Numbness. It's been pretty uncomfortable.","Clinically, this pattern points toward Sciatica, indicating a probable diagnosis of Herniated Disc.","Disease: CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS
Treatment: treatment
 In acute painful situation rest, moist heat in cold weather and light massage (improves
tone, circulation and elasticity) to paraspinal muscles. Cervical traction in the position of
maximum comfort to neck (5-10 pounds) for 10-15 minutes. Ultrasonic exposure on
painful trigger points in cervical and shoulder muscles. Inter ferential therapy (IFT) for
acute neck and back pain. Removable soft cervical collar/back corset/ back belt for
symptomatic relief.
(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips
tilted forward is probably the best.

"I am dealing with e Joint Pain, Swelling recently, and It's worrying me a bit.","Based on the symptoms, the likely cause is Rheumatoid Arthritis, which typically leads to  Arthritis.","Disease: ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Treatment: treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
The goals ofprophylactic administrationof antibioticsto surgical patients are to:
 Reduce the incidence of surgical site infection;
320
Surgery
 Use antibiotics in a manner that is supported by evidence of effectiveness; minimize the
effect of antibiotics on the patient's normal bacterial flora; adverse effects.
Prophylaxis is uniformly recommended for all clean-contaminated, contaminated and
dirty procedures. It is considered optional for most clean procedures, although it may be
indicated for certain patients and clean procedures that fulfill specific risk criteria. It is
important to emphasize that surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an adjunct to, not a
substitute for goodsurgical technique.
 Antibiotics prophylaxis should be regarded as one component of an effective policy for
the control of hospital acquired infection in procedure that requires the insertion of
implants or prosthetic devices, the term. Surgical site infection is used to encompass the
surgical wound and the implant. Surgical site infection also encompasses infections
involving the body cavity (e.g. subphrenic abscess), bones, joints, meninges and other
tissues involved in the operation. Throughout this guideline the term surgical site
infection (SSl) is used, unless the evidence relates specifically to surgical wound
infection."

deficiency anaemia.
Parenteral Iron Therapy
 It is rarely required. However, when oral iron is not tolerated, severe ADRs to oral iron or
presence of malabsorption syndromes, parenteral iron therapy may be used.
 Total dose of iron is: Iron(mg) = wt(kg) x Hb deficit (g/dl) x 4
 Injection iron dextran or iron sorbitol citrate (50 mg/ml) deep gluteal IM injection is
preferred.
Blood Transfusion
 When Hb is less than 3g% or Hb 4-6 g% in cardiac compromised patient
 PCV 15 ml/kg at rate of 4-5 ml/kg/hour
Patient/ parent education
 Iron deficiency anaemia occurs generally due to dietary deficiency of iron. Once the diet is
modified, the patient should stick to that diet.
 Iron should be taken between meals and never with tea or milk
 Intake of iron usually causes harmless black discolouration of teeth and stools. The teeth
discolouration can be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after doses."

agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

Common Conditions"
"I've been experiencing Dizziness, Fatigue, and it's starting to affect my daily activities.","Based on the symptoms, the likely cause is Dehydration, which typically leads to Heat Exhaustion.","Disease: STROKE
Treatment: treatment
 Rapid evaluation is necessary for the use of time sensitive treatments such as
thrombolysis. Close attention is paid to the ABC’s i.e. Airway, Breathing and Circulation
of the patient and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Once the diagnosis
of stroke is made, a brain imaging study is necessary to determine if the cause of stroke is
ischemia or hemorrhage. CT is useful in identifying early hemorrhage while MRI is
useful in identifying early infarct.
 Blood pressure should be lowered if there is malignant hypertension or concomitant
myocardial ischemia or if blood pressure is >185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic therapy is
anticipated (See section of hypertension)
 Fever is treated with antipyretics and surface cooling.
 Euglycemia is to be maintained.
 Between 5 and 10% of patients develop enough cerebral edema to cause herniation. Other
anti-edema measures such as head elevation, Tab. furosemide 40 mg OD and
hyperventilation are useful.
 Common complications of bedridden patients—infections (pneumonia, urinary, and skin)
and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolism are to be prevented.
 Intravenous thrombolysis (Table 1):
 Tab. aspirin 75 mg OD
 Inj. heparin 5000 IU SC
 Proper rehabilitation of the stroke patient includes early physical, occupational, and
speech therapy.
Secondary prevention of stroke and TIA
 Control of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation.
 Tab.aspirin 75-325 mg/day is recommended for stroke prevention.
 Tab. warfarin is useful for stroke prevention with a target INR of 2-3 in patients with
chronic nonvalvular AF as well as untreated rheumatic heart disease with AF.

 Inj. mannitol 20% 1g/kg stat followed by 0.5 g/kg IV infusion, Inj. furosemide 40 mg IV
stat, elevation of head end and hyperventilation are useful.
 Antihypertensive agents are instituted if BP is more than 180mmHg systolic or
>130mmHg diastolic. Goal is to keep a mean arterial pressure of less than 130mmHg.
 With thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/µl), transfusion of fresh platelets
is indicated.
 Patients with cerebellar hemorrhages or with depressed mental status and radiographic
evidence of hydrocephalus should undergo urgent neurosurgical evaluation.

"These past few days, Muscle Pain, Fatigue have been bothering me.","Clinically, this pattern points toward Overexertion, indicating a probable diagnosis of Muscle Strain.","Disease: PARAPLEGIA AND QUADRIPLEGIA
Treatment: treatment
 The treatment depends on the underlying etiology. E.g. compressive myelopathies usually
require urgent surgical intervention.
 Indications for corticosteroids in paraplegia: neoplastic spinal cord compression,
traumatic spinal cord injuries, acute transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis
optica, sarcoid myelitis, ADEM. The dose is Inj. methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3-5 days.
Continuation of steroids depends on the underlying cause.
 Fever: The loss of normal thermoregulation and inability to maintain normal body
temperature can produce recurrent fever (quadriplegic fever), although most episodes of
fever are due to infection of the urinary tract, lung, skin, or bone.
 Bladder dysfunction: It generally results from loss of supraspinal innervation of the
detrusor muscle of the bladder wall and the sphincter musculature.
- Detrusor spasticity is treated with anticholinergic drugs like Tab. oxybutynin 2.5–5
mg QID or tricyclic antidepressants that have anticholinergic properties, Tab.
imipramine, 25–200 mg/d.
- Failure of the sphincter muscle to relax during bladder emptying (urinary
dyssynergia) may be managed with the adrenergic blocking agent Tab. terazosin
hydrochloride 1–2 mg TDS or QID, with intermittent catheterization, or, if that is not
feasible, by use of a condom catheter in men or a permanent indwelling catheter.
- Bladder areflexia due to acute spinal shock or conus lesions is best treated by
catheterization.
- Surgical options include the creation of an artificial bladder.
 Bowel regimens and disimpaction are necessary in most patients to ensure at least
biweekly evacuation and avoid colonic distention or obstruction.
 During the first 2 weeks, use of calf-compression devices and anticoagulation with Inj.
heparin 5000 U SC every 12 h or Tab. warfarin (INR, 2–3) are recommended. In cases of
persistent paralysis, anticoagulation should probably be continued for 3 months.
 Prophylaxis against decubitus ulcers: frequent changes in position in a chair or bed, the
use of special mattresses such as water or air beds, and cushioning of areas where
103
Central Nervous System Diseases
pressure sores often develop, such as the sacral prominence and heels. Early treatment of
ulcers with careful cleansing, surgical or enzyme debridement of necrotic tissue, and
appropriate dressing and drainage.
 Spasticity: stretching exercises are recommended to maintain mobility of joints. Tab.
baclofen 15–240 mg/d in divided doses is effective. Tab. diazepam 2-4 mg at bed time
acts by a similar mechanism and is useful for leg spasms that interrupt sleep. Tab.
Tizanidine 2–8 mg TDS is another option."

screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15
degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from
the operator.
- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen. Anti-
reflective coating in the lenses should be used and avoid contact lens use during computer
work.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tear substitute should be considered if symptoms are aggravated during computer work.
Commercially available tear substitutes include sodium carboxymethylcellulose and
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

Treatment: treatment
Blood urea, All 3 investigations in moderate to severe dehydration, SE in
S. electrolytes (SE) and persistent vomiting or signs of dyselectrolytaemia, ABG in
arterial blood gas (ABG) respiratory distress and no chest signs and sepsis (correct it
only if pH <7.25).

TLC, DLC, band cell count, months.
ESR and CRP
Blood culture Suspected sepsis, Before starting antibiotics.
Chest X-ray, CSF and others As and when required
Stool culture No role
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."
"These past few days, Back Pain, Numbness have been bothering me.","These signs are commonly associated with Sciatica, a condition that may result in Herniated Disc.","Disease: CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS
Treatment: treatment
 In acute painful situation rest, moist heat in cold weather and light massage (improves
tone, circulation and elasticity) to paraspinal muscles. Cervical traction in the position of
maximum comfort to neck (5-10 pounds) for 10-15 minutes. Ultrasonic exposure on
painful trigger points in cervical and shoulder muscles. Inter ferential therapy (IFT) for
acute neck and back pain. Removable soft cervical collar/back corset/ back belt for
symptomatic relief.
(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips
tilted forward is probably the best.

Salient features
 Somatic symptoms include feeling of bloating, bodyaches, breast tenderness,
headache, food cravings and poor concentration.
 Emotional symptoms include emotional hypersensitivity, depression, irritability,
mood swings, anxiety, tension, fear of loss of control and confusion.
 Diagnosis is confirmed by excluding the concomitant medical or psychiatric
disorders with which it may be confused (depending on the symptoms).
Non- pharmacological treatment
Life-style advice should be offered to all women as first line of treatment.
1. Daily charting of symptoms for two months.
2. Dietary modifications like: increase complex carbohydrate meals, reduce or eliminate,
especially in the luteal phase - salts, chocolate, caffeine and alcohol; and several small
meals per day.

weight gain, breast tenderness), Tab. spironolactone 100 mg/day Or Tab. bromocriptine
1.25 - 5 mg/day in the luteal phase for mastalgia. (Common side effects are nausea and
vomiting. Tablet can be given vaginally if side effects are very severe.)
4. If no relief in symptoms with above measures in 2 - 3 cycles and symptoms are
predominantly emotional, then the following drugs are used preferably in consultation
with a psychiatrist: Tab. fluoxetine 5-20 mg/day

"These past few days, Chest Pain, Shortness of breath have been bothering me.","Clinically, this pattern points toward Physical Exertion, indicating a probable diagnosis of Muscle Overuse.","Disease: BRONCHIAL ASTHMA
Treatment: treatment.
Salient features
 Precipitating allergens are dust, pollen, fish, nuts, strawberries, cold air, tobacco smoke,
viral and bacterial infections, exercise, emotional stress and drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin,
beta-blocker
 Classical symptoms include cough, breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing. Signs
include tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles, silent chest
Diagnosis
 When asthma is suspected and other disorders have been ruled out (e.g. tumours in adults,
foreign body in children; don’t assume the presence of wheeze means asthma), confirm
the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
 PFTs suffice as objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:
A 12 % or greater improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in children and
adults, and > 200 ml in adults from the baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled
-
short-acting beta2 agonist.
Serial measures of peak expiratory flow (PEF): A > 20% change after administration
of a bronchodilator.
-
 When there is some probability of asthma and the above tests are non-diagnostic, the
following tests may be used to help diagnosis of asthma:
Methacholine challenge
Exercise challenge
-
Inhaled corticosteroid trial: appropriate doses of inhaled steroids for 4-6 weeks
-
Raised value of absolute eosinophil count (>6-8%)
-
Non pharmacological treatment
-
 Evaluate and assess impact and exposure to allergens and irritants in individual patients.
 Complete cessation of smoking and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is
strongly recommended.
 Lifestyle management-"
"These past few days, Joint Pain, Swelling have been bothering me.","The symptoms suggest Rheumatoid Arthritis, and the patient may be experiencing Arthritis.","Disease: ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Treatment: treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

Treatment: treatment
These medications should be reserved for short-term control of active vertigo. They are less
helpful for chronic dizziness and may hinder central compensation.
 Antihistamines like Tab. meclizine (25–50 mg 3 times daily), Tab. dimenhydrinate (50
mg 1–2 times daily) and Tab. promethazine (25 mg 2–3 times daily, also can be given
rectally and IM)
 Benzodiazepines like Tab. diazepam (2.5 mg 1–3 times daily) and Tab. clonazepam (0.25
mg 1 –3 times daily.
 Anticholinergic agents like scopolamine transdermal patch (for motion sickness only)
 Physical therapylike repositioningmanoeuvres (for BPPV)
 Diuretics and/or low-sodium (1 g/d) diet (for Ménière's disease)
 Antimigrainous drugs (for vestibular migraine)
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for psychosomatic vertigo)
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
 A common cause of recurrent vertigo
 Episodes are brief (less than 1 min and typically 15–20 s)
 Always provoked by changes in head position relative to gravity, such as lying down,
rolling over in bed, rising from a supine position, and extending the head to look upward.
 With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally
 Horizontal canal BPPV resulting in a horizontal nystagmus
 Superior (also called anterior) canal involvement is rare.
 BPPV is treated with repositioning maneuvers that utilize gravity to remove the otoconia
from the semicircular canal.
 For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is the most commonly used procedure.
Vestibular Migraine
 Usually part of migraine aura but can occur independently. The duration of vertigo may
be from minutes to hours. Vestibular migraine typically is treated with medications that
are used for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
 Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the time of an attack.(See vomiting
section)
Ménière's Disease
 Attack consists of vertigo, hearing loss, & pain, pressure or fullness in affected ear.
 Diuretics and sodium restriction are the initial treatments.
 If attacks persist, injections of gentamicin into the middle ear or full ablative procedures
are required.
 Tab. betahistine 24-48 mg/day relieves pressure from excess fluid. Initial dose 16 mg
TDS initially with maintenance.

Central Nervous System Diseases
Psychosomatic Dizziness/vertigo
 Important role in chronic dizziness
 Dizziness may be a somatic manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as major
depression, anxiety, or panic disorder.
 Thus, treatment with antianxiety medications and cognitive/behavioral therapy may be
helpful.

Treatment: Treatment
Routine use of antipyretics in low-grade fever is not justified. This may mask important clinical
indications. However, in acute febrile illnesses suggestive of viral or bacterial cause, fever
should be treated.
Non pharmacological treatment
Hydrotherapy and rest
Pharmacological treatment
Non-specific
 Tab. paracetamol 500-1000 mg 6-8 hourly. Or Tab. ibuprofen 400-600 mg 8 hourly.
Specific
 Antibiotics/antimalarials depending upon the cause suggested by clinical and laboratory
evaluation.
Outcome
In most cases of fever, patient may either recover spontaneously or a diagnosis is reached after
repeated clinical evaluation and investigations. If no diagnosis is reached in up to 3 weeks,
patient is said to be having fever of unknown origin (FUO) and should be managed accordingly.
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Avoid covering the patient having high fever with blanket etc.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in cool environment. Cold sponging of face and limbs
should bedone repeatedly.

Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

Salient features
Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa
 Flushing, itching, urticaria (hives), angioedema, morbilliform rash, piloerection
 Periorbital itching, erythema and edema, conjunctival erythema, tearing
 Itching of lips, tongue, palate, and external auditory canals; and swelling of lips, tongue,
and uvula
 Itching of genitalia, palms, and soles
Respiratory
 Nasal itching, congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing
 Throat itching and tightness, dysphonia, hoarseness, stridor, dry staccato cough

wheezing/bronchospasm, decreased peak expiratory flow
 Cyanosis, respiratory arrest
Gastrointestinal
 Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (stringy mucus), diarrhea, dysphagia
Cardiovascular system
 Chest pain
 Tachycardia, bradycardia (less common), other arrhythmias, palpitations
 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

Eye Diseases
 Counselling regarding the syndrome and work environment modification
Steps for relieving computer eye strain
- Get a computerized eye exam before start using computer. Repeat once a year.
- Use proper lighting. Eliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce
interior lightingby using lower intensity bulbs and tubes.
- Minimize glare: To install an anti-glare screen on your monitor. Paint bright white walls a
darker color with a matt finish.
- Upgrade your display. Use LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.
- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen.
- Blink more often.
- Exercise your eyes: Follow 20-20-20 rule i.e. after every 20 minutes, look at 20 feet
distance for 20 seconds.
- Take frequent breaks - two 15-minute breaks -four additional five-minute ""minibreaks""
throughout the work day (6-8 hrs).
- Modify your workstation. Proper posture during computer work. Position computer
screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15
degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from
the operator.
- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen. Anti-
reflective coating in the lenses should be used and avoid contact lens use during computer
work.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tear substitute should be considered if symptoms are aggravated during computer work.
Commercially available tear substitutes include sodium carboxymethylcellulose and
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

Non-pharmacological treatment
 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."
"I've been experiencing Back Pain, Numbness, and it's starting to affect my daily activities.","This presentation aligns with Sciatica, often seen in cases of Herniated Disc.","Disease: CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS
Treatment: treatment
 In acute painful situation rest, moist heat in cold weather and light massage (improves
tone, circulation and elasticity) to paraspinal muscles. Cervical traction in the position of
maximum comfort to neck (5-10 pounds) for 10-15 minutes. Ultrasonic exposure on
painful trigger points in cervical and shoulder muscles. Inter ferential therapy (IFT) for
acute neck and back pain. Removable soft cervical collar/back corset/ back belt for
symptomatic relief.
(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips
tilted forward is probably the best.

Main approaches used are cognitive and behavioral therapies which aim at providing psycho
education and correcting cognitive distortions. It also includes educating the patient about
relaxation techniques and respiratorytraining.
 Family therapy includes providing psycho education and support
 Insight orientated psychotherapy is focused on helping patients to understand unconscious
meaning of anxiety and resolution of conflicts.
Pharmacological treatment
 SSRIs particularly paroxetine are effective in treating panic disorders. Other SSRIs like
escitalopram, citalopram, fluvoxamine and sertraline are also useful.
 Alprazolam is the most widely used benzodiazepine (start with 0.25 mg/day 1 HS upto
maximum of 6 mg/day). Theyare used for providing rapid symptomatic relief.
 Inj. lorazepam 2mg/ml and diazepam 5ml/ml can be used in patients presenting with
acute anxiety.
 Tri cyclic anti depressants like amitriptyline are also useful

"These past few days, Chest Pain, Shortness of breath have been bothering me.","This presentation aligns with Physical Exertion, often seen in cases of Muscle Overuse.","Disease: BRONCHIAL ASTHMA
Treatment: treatment.
Salient features
 Precipitating allergens are dust, pollen, fish, nuts, strawberries, cold air, tobacco smoke,
viral and bacterial infections, exercise, emotional stress and drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin,
beta-blocker
 Classical symptoms include cough, breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing. Signs
include tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles, silent chest
Diagnosis
 When asthma is suspected and other disorders have been ruled out (e.g. tumours in adults,
foreign body in children; don’t assume the presence of wheeze means asthma), confirm
the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
 PFTs suffice as objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:
A 12 % or greater improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in children and
adults, and > 200 ml in adults from the baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled
-
short-acting beta2 agonist.
Serial measures of peak expiratory flow (PEF): A > 20% change after administration
of a bronchodilator.
-
 When there is some probability of asthma and the above tests are non-diagnostic, the
following tests may be used to help diagnosis of asthma:
Methacholine challenge
Exercise challenge
-
Inhaled corticosteroid trial: appropriate doses of inhaled steroids for 4-6 weeks
-
Raised value of absolute eosinophil count (>6-8%)
-
Non pharmacological treatment
-
 Evaluate and assess impact and exposure to allergens and irritants in individual patients.
 Complete cessation of smoking and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is
strongly recommended.
 Lifestyle management-"
"I've been experiencing Joint Pain, Swelling, and it's starting to affect my daily activities.","This presentation aligns with Rheumatoid Arthritis, often seen in cases of Arthritis.","Disease: ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS
Treatment: treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

Treatment: treatment
These medications should be reserved for short-term control of active vertigo. They are less
helpful for chronic dizziness and may hinder central compensation.
 Antihistamines like Tab. meclizine (25–50 mg 3 times daily), Tab. dimenhydrinate (50
mg 1–2 times daily) and Tab. promethazine (25 mg 2–3 times daily, also can be given
rectally and IM)
 Benzodiazepines like Tab. diazepam (2.5 mg 1–3 times daily) and Tab. clonazepam (0.25
mg 1 –3 times daily.
 Anticholinergic agents like scopolamine transdermal patch (for motion sickness only)
 Physical therapylike repositioningmanoeuvres (for BPPV)
 Diuretics and/or low-sodium (1 g/d) diet (for Ménière's disease)
 Antimigrainous drugs (for vestibular migraine)
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for psychosomatic vertigo)
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
 A common cause of recurrent vertigo
 Episodes are brief (less than 1 min and typically 15–20 s)
 Always provoked by changes in head position relative to gravity, such as lying down,
rolling over in bed, rising from a supine position, and extending the head to look upward.
 With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally
 Horizontal canal BPPV resulting in a horizontal nystagmus
 Superior (also called anterior) canal involvement is rare.
 BPPV is treated with repositioning maneuvers that utilize gravity to remove the otoconia
from the semicircular canal.
 For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is the most commonly used procedure.
Vestibular Migraine
 Usually part of migraine aura but can occur independently. The duration of vertigo may
be from minutes to hours. Vestibular migraine typically is treated with medications that
are used for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
 Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the time of an attack.(See vomiting
section)
Ménière's Disease
 Attack consists of vertigo, hearing loss, & pain, pressure or fullness in affected ear.
 Diuretics and sodium restriction are the initial treatments.
 If attacks persist, injections of gentamicin into the middle ear or full ablative procedures
are required.
 Tab. betahistine 24-48 mg/day relieves pressure from excess fluid. Initial dose 16 mg
TDS initially with maintenance.
105
Central Nervous System Diseases
Psychosomatic Dizziness/vertigo
 Important role in chronic dizziness
 Dizziness may be a somatic manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as major
depression, anxiety, or panic disorder.
 Thus, treatment with antianxiety medications and cognitive/behavioral therapy may be
helpful.

Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
The goals ofprophylactic administrationof antibioticsto surgical patients are to:
 Reduce the incidence of surgical site infection;
320
Surgery
 Use antibiotics in a manner that is supported by evidence of effectiveness; minimize the
effect of antibiotics on the patient's normal bacterial flora; adverse effects.
Prophylaxis is uniformly recommended for all clean-contaminated, contaminated and
dirty procedures. It is considered optional for most clean procedures, although it may be
indicated for certain patients and clean procedures that fulfill specific risk criteria. It is
important to emphasize that surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an adjunct to, not a
substitute for goodsurgical technique.
 Antibiotics prophylaxis should be regarded as one component of an effective policy for
the control of hospital acquired infection in procedure that requires the insertion of
implants or prosthetic devices, the term. Surgical site infection is used to encompass the
surgical wound and the implant. Surgical site infection also encompasses infections
involving the body cavity (e.g. subphrenic abscess), bones, joints, meninges and other
tissues involved in the operation. Throughout this guideline the term surgical site
infection (SSl) is used, unless the evidence relates specifically to surgical wound
infection."

 Treatment depends on hemoglobin levels and age of the patients
Pharmacological treatment-Oral Iron Therapy
 Oral ferrous salts (sulphate, gluconate etc) are the preferred therapeutic iron preparations.
 Therapeutic iron dose: 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 2 – 3 divided doses to be given
between meals for 2 months after normal Hb concentration for age is achieved.
 In prematurity start iron syrup from 2nd week of life to 1 year.
 Response to therapy – decreased irritability and improved appetite is seen within 12 – 24
hours. Rise in Hb levels seen within 7 days at the rate of 0.25 –0.4 g/dl/day.

Pediatric Conditions
 If the response is inadequate, check for the prescribed dose, compliance, presence of
diarrhoea or malnutrition, infections or β thalas semia trait mistakenly diagnosed as iron
deficiency anaemia.
Parenteral Iron Therapy
 It is rarely required. However, when oral iron is not tolerated, severe ADRs to oral iron or
presence of malabsorption syndromes, parenteral iron therapy may be used.
 Total dose of iron is: Iron(mg) = wt(kg) x Hb deficit (g/dl) x 4
 Injection iron dextran or iron sorbitol citrate (50 mg/ml) deep gluteal IM injection is
preferred.
Blood Transfusion
 When Hb is less than 3g% or Hb 4-6 g% in cardiac compromised patient
 PCV 15 ml/kg at rate of 4-5 ml/kg/hour
Patient/ parent education
 Iron deficiency anaemia occurs generally due to dietary deficiency of iron. Once the diet is
modified, the patient should stick to that diet.
 Iron should be taken between meals and never with tea or milk
 Intake of iron usually causes harmless black discolouration of teeth and stools. The teeth
discolouration can be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after doses."

 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.

Pharmacological treatment
Non-specific
 Tab. paracetamol 500-1000 mg 6-8 hourly. Or Tab. ibuprofen 400-600 mg 8 hourly.
Specific
 Antibiotics/antimalarials depending upon the cause suggested by clinical and laboratory
evaluation.
Outcome
In most cases of fever, patient may either recover spontaneously or a diagnosis is reached after
repeated clinical evaluation and investigations. If no diagnosis is reached in up to 3 weeks,
patient is said to be having fever of unknown origin (FUO) and should be managed accordingly.
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Avoid covering the patient having high fever with blanket etc.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in cool environment. Cold sponging of face and limbs
should bedone repeatedly.

Treatment: treatment
 Since the etiology of RA is unknown, therapy remains empirical and palliative, aimed at
relieving the signs and symptoms of the disease.
 In acute pain rest and splint. Otherwise exercises directed at maintaining muscle strength
and joint mobility without exacerbating joint inflammation. A variety of orthotic (splints)
and assistive devices (cane, walker) can be helpful in supporting and aligning deformed
joints to reduce pain and improve function.
Pharmacological treatment
 In acute inflammation any of the NSAIDs as given in section on osteoarthritis may be
given except paracetamol. The anti-inflammatory action of the NSAIDs may take 2-4
weeks to become evident. Evaluation of persistent polyarthritis.
 Reduced NSAID dosages have to be used in the elderly and in patients with impaired
renal function. Concomitant use of more than one NSAID only increases toxicity, and has
no additional benefit. Patient not responding to one NSAID may still show a good
response to another.

Treatment: treatment
 Rapid evaluation is necessary for the use of time sensitive treatments such as
thrombolysis. Close attention is paid to the ABC’s i.e. Airway, Breathing and Circulation
of the patient and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Once the diagnosis
of stroke is made, a brain imaging study is necessary to determine if the cause of stroke is
ischemia or hemorrhage. CT is useful in identifying early hemorrhage while MRI is
useful in identifying early infarct.
 Blood pressure should be lowered if there is malignant hypertension or concomitant
myocardial ischemia or if blood pressure is >185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic therapy is
anticipated (See section of hypertension)
 Fever is treated with antipyretics and surface cooling.
 Euglycemia is to be maintained.
 Between 5 and 10% of patients develop enough cerebral edema to cause herniation. Other
anti-edema measures such as head elevation, Tab. furosemide 40 mg OD and
hyperventilation are useful.
 Common complications of bedridden patients—infections (pneumonia, urinary, and skin)
and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolism are to be prevented.
 Intravenous thrombolysis (Table 1):
 Tab. aspirin 75 mg OD
 Inj. heparin 5000 IU SC
 Proper rehabilitation of the stroke patient includes early physical, occupational, and
speech therapy.
Secondary prevention of stroke and TIA
 Control of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation.
 Tab.aspirin 75-325 mg/day is recommended for stroke prevention.
 Tab. warfarin is useful for stroke prevention with a target INR of 2-3 in patients with
chronic nonvalvular AF as well as untreated rheumatic heart disease with AF.

Treatment: Treatment
Routine use of antipyretics in low-grade fever is not justified. This may mask important clinical
indications. However, in acute febrile illnesses suggestive of viral or bacterial cause, fever
should be treated.
Non pharmacological treatment
Hydrotherapy and rest
Pharmacological treatment
Non-specific
 Tab. paracetamol 500-1000 mg 6-8 hourly. Or Tab. ibuprofen 400-600 mg 8 hourly.
Specific
 Antibiotics/antimalarials depending upon the cause suggested by clinical and laboratory
evaluation.
Outcome
In most cases of fever, patient may either recover spontaneously or a diagnosis is reached after
repeated clinical evaluation and investigations. If no diagnosis is reached in up to 3 weeks,
patient is said to be having fever of unknown origin (FUO) and should be managed accordingly.
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Avoid covering the patient having high fever with blanket etc.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in cool environment. Cold sponging of face and limbs
should bedone repeatedly.

Salient features
 Precipitating allergens are dust, pollen, fish, nuts, strawberries, cold air, tobacco smoke,
viral and bacterial infections, exercise, emotional stress and drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin,
beta-blocker
 Classical symptoms include cough, breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing. Signs
include tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles, silent chest
Diagnosis
 When asthma is suspected and other disorders have been ruled out (e.g. tumours in adults,
foreign body in children; don’t assume the presence of wheeze means asthma), confirm
the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
 PFTs suffice as objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:
A 12 % or greater improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in children and
adults, and > 200 ml in adults from the baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled
-
short-acting beta2 agonist.
Serial measures of peak expiratory flow (PEF): A > 20% change after administration
of a bronchodilator.
-
 When there is some probability of asthma and the above tests are non-diagnostic, the
following tests may be used to help diagnosis of asthma:
Methacholine challenge
Exercise challenge
-
Inhaled corticosteroid trial: appropriate doses of inhaled steroids for 4-6 weeks
-
Raised value of absolute eosinophil count (>6-8%)
-
Non pharmacological treatment

 Evaluate and assess impact and exposure to allergens and irritants in individual patients.
 Complete cessation of smoking and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is
strongly recommended.

Treatment: treatment depends on
prompt diagnosis and rapid supplementation of appropriate therapy.
Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline
52
Emergency Conditions
Salient features
Skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa
 Flushing, itching, urticaria (hives), angioedema, morbilliform rash, piloerection
 Periorbital itching, erythema and edema, conjunctival erythema, tearing
 Itching of lips, tongue, palate, and external auditory canals; and swelling of lips, tongue,
and uvula
 Itching of genitalia, palms, and soles
Respiratory
 Nasal itching, congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing
 Throat itching and tightness, dysphonia, hoarseness, stridor, dry staccato cough
 Lower airways: increased respiratory rate, shortness of breath, chest tightness, deep cough,
wheezing/bronchospasm, decreased peak expiratory flow
 Cyanosis, respiratory arrest
Gastrointestinal
 Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (stringy mucus), diarrhea, dysphagia
Cardiovascular system
 Chest pain
 Tachycardia, bradycardia (less common), other arrhythmias, palpitations
 Hypotension, feeling faint, urinary or fecal incontinence, shock
 Cardiac arrest
Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

"I started feeling Muscle Pain, Fatigue, and it doesn't seem to be improving.","Clinically, this pattern points toward Overexertion        , indicating a probable diagnosis of Muscle Strain  .","Disease: PARAPLEGIA AND QUADRIPLEGIA
Treatment: treatment
 The treatment depends on the underlying etiology. E.g. compressive myelopathies usually
require urgent surgical intervention.
 Indications for corticosteroids in paraplegia: neoplastic spinal cord compression,
traumatic spinal cord injuries, acute transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis
optica, sarcoid myelitis, ADEM. The dose is Inj. methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3-5 days.
Continuation of steroids depends on the underlying cause.
 Fever: The loss of normal thermoregulation and inability to maintain normal body
temperature can produce recurrent fever (quadriplegic fever), although most episodes of
fever are due to infection of the urinary tract, lung, skin, or bone.
 Bladder dysfunction: It generally results from loss of supraspinal innervation of the
detrusor muscle of the bladder wall and the sphincter musculature.
- Detrusor spasticity is treated with anticholinergic drugs like Tab. oxybutynin 2.5–5
mg QID or tricyclic antidepressants that have anticholinergic properties, Tab.
imipramine, 25–200 mg/d.
- Failure of the sphincter muscle to relax during bladder emptying (urinary
dyssynergia) may be managed with the adrenergic blocking agent Tab. terazosin
hydrochloride 1–2 mg TDS or QID, with intermittent catheterization, or, if that is not
feasible, by use of a condom catheter in men or a permanent indwelling catheter.
- Bladder areflexia due to acute spinal shock or conus lesions is best treated by
catheterization.
- Surgical options include the creation of an artificial bladder.
 Bowel regimens and disimpaction are necessary in most patients to ensure at least
biweekly evacuation and avoid colonic distention or obstruction.
 During the first 2 weeks, use of calf-compression devices and anticoagulation with Inj.
heparin 5000 U SC every 12 h or Tab. warfarin (INR, 2–3) are recommended. In cases of
persistent paralysis, anticoagulation should probably be continued for 3 months.
 Prophylaxis against decubitus ulcers: frequent changes in position in a chair or bed, the
use of special mattresses such as water or air beds, and cushioning of areas where
103
Central Nervous System Diseases
pressure sores often develop, such as the sacral prominence and heels. Early treatment of
ulcers with careful cleansing, surgical or enzyme debridement of necrotic tissue, and
appropriate dressing and drainage.
 Spasticity: stretching exercises are recommended to maintain mobility of joints. Tab.
baclofen 15–240 mg/d in divided doses is effective. Tab. diazepam 2-4 mg at bed time
acts by a similar mechanism and is useful for leg spasms that interrupt sleep. Tab.
Tizanidine 2–8 mg TDS is another option."
"Lately, I've noticed symptoms like Nausea, Vomiting. It's been pretty uncomfortable.","Clinically, this pattern points toward Food Poisoning  , indicating a probable diagnosis of Muscle Strain  .","Disease: TETANUS
Treatment: management depends on grade.
Investigations
 Clinical - culture of C. tetani from a wound provides supportive evidence. The few
conditions that mimic generalized tetanus include strychnine poisoning and dystonic
reactions to antidopaminergic drugs. Abdominal muscle rigidity is characteristically
continuous in tetanus but is episodic in the latter two conditions. Cephalic tetanus can be
confused with other causes of trismus, such as oropharyngeal infection.
 Hypocalcemia and meningoencephalitis are included in the differential diagnosis of
neonatal tetanus.
Grading
 Mild or grade 1 –muscle rigidity with few or no spasms.
 Moderate or grade 2-trismus, dysphagia, rigidity and short lasting spasms.
 Severe or grade 3- frequent explosive spasms, autonomic dysfunction particularly
sympathetic over activity may be present.
 Very severe or grade 4- features of grade 3 plus violent autonomic disturbances involving
the CVS –severe hyper or hypotension.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Admit in a quiet room orICU with minimum stimulation.
 Protection of airways (intubation/tracheostomy) with or without mechanical ventilation.
Monitorcardiovascular parameters.
 Cleaning/exploration/debridement of wound
 Maintain hydration and enteral/parentral nutrition with high calorie and high protein diet.
Pharmacological treatment
Grade 1
 Tab. diazepam 5-20 mg 3 times a day; slow IV infusion in moderate to severe tetanus; not
exceed a dose of 80-100mg in 24 hours.
 If spasms not controlled, Inj. phenobarbitone 200mg IM every 8-12 hours or Inj.
chlorpromazine 50 mg IM in adults 4 times a day.
138
Infections
 The ideal sedative and muscle relaxant schedule for each patient should be individualized.
An objective guide to decrease in rigidity is relaxation of abdominal muscles.
Grade 2
 Tracheostomy
Grade 3 and 4
 Ventilatory support
 Inj.pancuronium 2-4mg or gallamine 20-40mg IV.
 If hypotension, give vasopressor support and ifhypertension, give antihypertensive.
 For bradyarrythmias, Inj.atropine 0.6-1.2 mg IV.
In addition,give following to all patients;
 Inj. crystalline 2 mega units 6 hourly IV for 10 days or Inj. metronidazole 500mg 8 hourly
or 1gm 12 hourly. Requirement may be according to theinfected wound.
 Inj. human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000-5000 units IV or IM or Inj. equine
antiserum 10000 units by slow IV injection after sensitivity test when human TIG is not
available.
 Antiserum should be given before local manipulation of the wound."

Steps for relieving computer eye strain
- Get a computerized eye exam before start using computer. Repeat once a year.
- Use proper lighting. Eliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce
interior lightingby using lower intensity bulbs and tubes.
- Minimize glare: To install an anti-glare screen on your monitor. Paint bright white walls a
darker color with a matt finish.
- Upgrade your display. Use LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.
- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen.
- Blink more often.
- Exercise your eyes: Follow 20-20-20 rule i.e. after every 20 minutes, look at 20 feet
distance for 20 seconds.
- Take frequent breaks - two 15-minute breaks -four additional five-minute ""minibreaks""
throughout the work day (6-8 hrs).
- Modify your workstation. Proper posture during computer work. Position computer
screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15
degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from
the operator.
- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen. Anti-
reflective coating in the lenses should be used and avoid contact lens use during computer
work.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tear substitute should be considered if symptoms are aggravated during computer work.
Commercially available tear substitutes include sodium carboxymethylcellulose and
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.
