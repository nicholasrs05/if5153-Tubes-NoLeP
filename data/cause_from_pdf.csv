Preface
When Something Feels Wrong
Symptoms are what you feel when your body’s machinery isn’t work-
ing perfectly. About twenty symptoms account for most of the reasons
people go to health professionals. People visit a health professional
when the symptoms limit daily activities. They also visit health pro-
fessionals to learn whether their symptoms indicate an increased risk
for serious problems.
The most common group of symptoms is caused when a “bug” (bac-
teria or virus) has invaded the body. The typical symptoms of a “bug”
are cough, fever, chills, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, earache,
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. When caused by a “bug,” these symp-
toms usually resolve within three weeks.
Symptoms caused by bacteria or viruses are particularly common in
young children because the child’s body is just learning how to fight
the most common “bugs.” We call this building up immunity. Immu-
nizations are given to young children to help speed up this process
and eliminate the problems caused when these bugs are able to
invade the body. It’s important to note that in children and adults,
symptoms caused by viruses will not be helped by antibiotics.
The next most common symptoms are those related to “wear and
tear” on the body. Low back, knee, leg, foot, hand, neck, and shoul-
der pains are most often caused by “wear and tear.” These symptoms
persist for weeks, months, or a lifetime.
After these two groupings, there a number of common symptoms
with several or less obvious causes: headaches, abdominal (belly)
pains, shortness of breath (difficulty breathing), chest pains, red or
itching skin, emotional problems, dizziness, tiredness, and fatigue.
These symptoms tend to occur again and again.
When Symptoms Limit Daily Activities
The more numerous, severe, and persistent our symptoms, the more
they limit our ability to perform daily activities. Among adults,

X PREFACE
persistent “wear and tear” pains, anxiety or depression, dizziness or
fatigue, and trouble sleeping frequently limit activities.
There are notable differences in the frequency of several bother-
some, persistent symptoms by age and gender. Preteen, teen, and
young women are more often bothered by headaches than males.
Trouble paying attention is the most common problem for preteen
and teen males. Sleep problems are more common as we age. Older
people are frequently bothered by problems with urination, consti-
pation, and hearing.
When Symptoms Might Indicate a Serious Problem
The overwhelming majority of symptoms are not a sign of a serious
problem. That means that the body could heal itself without pro-
fessional help. But large studies of symptoms show three interest-
ing patterns.
First, while in children and adolescents the “bug-related” symptoms
listed above are self-limited almost all of the time, fever and cough
in the very old had a potentially serious cause about 5 to 10 times
out of 100. The most common serious cause in the studies was an
infection of the lung (pneumonia) that might have benefitted from
antibiotics.
Second, about 5 to 10 out of 100 abdominal and chest pains suffered
by adults in the studies were likely to have serious causes; in adoles-
cents and children, these problems were very seldom serious.
Third, across all ages, shortness of breath (difficulty breathing)
seemed to be the most common treatable symptom. About half of
the time, professional treatment really helps cure or make less both-
ersome the causes for shortness of breath.
Symptoms Are Like Street Signs
What do these general patterns mean? If you are an older adult
you should worry a bit more about cough, fever, chest pain, and
abdominal pain. If you have persistent trouble breathing, see a
health professional.
FM_Wasson_141618-8 6/15/04 1:09 PM Page xi
PREFACE XI
Unfortunately, a symptom is often just like a street sign. It can tell
you roughly were you are, but without a specific address, you can
easily end up in the wrong neighborhood. Cough is a common street
sign for heart and lung problems. Cough with a fever of 103 degrees
and shortness of breath that has lasted two days is closer to being an
address for infection of the lung (pneumonia).
Combining such street signs, the way you would specify an address
by providing the intersection of two streets, can help your doctor
zoom in on a diagnosis. There’s also common sense: Over millions of
years, humans have survived because they “sense” when they are
really sick. For example, rapidly progressive, severe symptoms usu-
ally require prompt action.
The a–z Common Symptom Answer Guide is intended to help you
determine the possible causes for your symptoms, and to prepare
you for what your doctor’s visit for those symptoms may be like. It
provides you with more than street signs—it places you in the correct
neighborhood. But it won’t establish a specific address or diagnosis.
For example, the lungs need to be examined by a health professional
to make the diagnosis and prescribe treatment for pneumonia. The
a–z Common Symptom Answer Guide is not an adequate substitute
for the judgment of a health professional—it’s just a very helpful
guide map.

How to Use This Book
Feeling sick is, it goes without saying, a miserable experience. But
on top of the aches, pains, and fatigue that go with many illnesses,
there’s the anxiety of not knowing what condition you might have,
and not knowing what to expect when you go to your doctor’s office.
There are many health resources available today, particularly on the
Internet. Many, however, are meant for health care professionals, and
among those that aren’t, only a small percentage are accurate, with
information vetted by doctors and nurses.
That’s where the a–z Common Symptom Answer Guide comes in.
Written in plain English —not the medicalese of ERor scientific jour-
nals—this book is designed to help you think about your symptoms
and to prepare you for your doctor’s visit. It can then be used as a
handy reference after that visit to further explain and clarify anything
you didn’t have time to ask in the office or hospital.
The purpose is not to allow for self-diagnosis. Figuring out what ails
you is for your doctor to do. But by knowing what questions your
doctor might ask, you’ll help her make a more definitive diagnosis.
And by knowing what to expect, you’ll hopefully rest easier and be
more ready to cope with the information.
Organization
The book consists of seventy-five chapters, each named for a common
symptom, instead of being organized by diseases or conditions. All the
chapters are cross-referenced. That way, you can find the symptom
you’re experiencing, read about it, and, when appropriate, be referred
to another chapter of related conditions. For an overview of terms or
associations, refer to the Table of Contents, which lists all the chap-
ters, and the Glossary, which defines common medical terms so you’ll
know what they mean when your doctor uses them. Different people

XIV HOWTOUSETHISBOOK
have different names for symptoms and conditions; this way you’ll be
on the same page.
Each chapter begins with a “What it feels like” and “What can make
it worse” section. Here, you’ll find quick versions of what you might
be experiencing. For example, certain medications can worsen some
symptoms.
The next section of each chapter is “Your Doctor Visit.” In that sec-
tion, you’ll find a list of questions your doctor might ask and a
description of the examinations or tests he might perform. Many
times, doctors can be guided quickly to the correct diagnosis by know-
ing the medical history of a patient or her family, but this information
isn’t always easily available. It’s particularly easy to forget such details
when you’re not feeling well. If, before going to the doctor, you read
through the questions you may be asked, you may avoid this problem.
The last section of each chapter is a table or list of conditions and
diseases that might be causing your symptoms. Each condition is
defined and described in clear English, with particular attention paid
to what might distinguish a particular diagnosis from another. For
example, many diseases can cause abdominal pain, but the exact
location of your pain may tell you the difference between an ulcer, an
inflamed appendix, or just constipation. The causes are ranked in
order of common to rare when possible.
An important note: Read the “typical symptoms” column carefully
when looking at the possible diagnoses, and don’t assume the worst.
For example, lung tumor is listed as one cause of hiccoughs. However,
unless you have an unrelenting cough, are coughing up blood, or have
a history of smoking cigarettes, it’s highly unlikely that your hic-
coughs are caused by a lung tumor.
Many of the chapters include additional statements and tidbits that
may be of particular importance. For example, there are steps to take
immediately after a child swallows a poison that won’t wait until a
doctor’s visit.
Staying Well—and Well-Informed
When you’ve returned from your doctor’s office or the hospital, refer
again to the a–z Common Symptom Answer Guide. You may find it
FM_Wasson_141618-8 6/15/04 1:09 PM Page xv
HOWTOUSETHISBOOK XV
particularly helpful to look up conditions or terms that your doctor
used, to remind yourself of what they mean. As your treatment pro-
gresses and your condition improves, you may also want to compare
your symptoms to what they were before, and reading the chapters
that describe them again may help.
It is also important to take an active role in your health, not just by
reacting to symptoms when they arise but by living a healthy lifestyle
that includes exercise. You can keep up with changes in your life or
in medicine that may affect your health in many ways. Having a reg-
ular physical is one such way. Your doctor may recommend other
material for your review and reference.
Be well!

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Alison McCook for her invaluable help in writ-
ing this book. My father, Stanley Oransky, MD, also has my gratitude
for offering advice and recommendations on the material covered.
The patients, professors, editors, and colleagues who taught me
about medicine and how to write deserve anonymous but generous
appreciation. Finally, the book would not have been possible with-
out the patience and talent of its editor, Andrea Seils, and the
encouragement of Jack Farrell, both of McGraw-Hill.

Severe burns can cause large amounts of fluid loss, as well as infections. Burns to the
face are particularly troublesome because associated damage to the lungs, which can
occur if hot air is breathed in, can lead to breathing difficulties. Electrical burns may
look less severe than they are because some of the damage is to internal organs.

Constipation (Child)
What it feels like: an inability to have regular and easy bowel
movements.
The most common cause of “constipation” in children is concern
from caregivers that they should have a bowel movement every day—
even though it is normal for children to pass stool as infrequently as
once or twice a week.
Anxiety from adults about toilet training can also be transmitted to
children, which can lead to constipation. In this situation, most chil-
dren develop normal bowel habits within two years.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about the child:vomiting, excessive
urination, crying during bowel movement, change in appetite,
abdominal swelling, blood in stool, soiling of underclothes, behav-
ioral problems.
Your doctor will want to know how many bowel movements the
child has each week, how many the child is expected to have,
and what kind of diet the child follows, including what kind of
formula, if any, is used, how it is diluted, and how much the
child eats.
Your doctor will want to know if the child is taking any
medications.
Your doctor will do a physical examination of the child, includ-
ing the following: weight, pushing on the abdomen, rectal exam,
thorough skin exam.

Ear Problems
What it feels like: varies from decreased hearing to ear pain to hear-
ing sounds that no one else does, such as ringing or buzzing (tinni-
tus).
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about: difficulty hearing in group
conversation, headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, ear pain, loss
of ability to “pop” ears, hearing loss, ear discharge, ringing or
buzzing in the ears, runny nose, sore throat, sensation of movement
or rotation, loss of equilibrium, ear pulling (child), the date of your
last ear exam, whether the pain is in one or both ears.
Your doctor will want to know if you or anyone in your family
has had any of these conditions:hearing trouble, high blood pres-
sure, nervous system disease, Meniere’s disease, ear infections, severe
head trauma, mumps.
Your doctor will want to know if your ear problems began after
swimming or bathing, or after spending time in a noisy environ-
ment. Your doctor will also ask if there is a possibility you have
an object in your ear.

ications: aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications,
antibiotics, diuretics (“water pills”), quinine, lithium.
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the fol-
lowing: thorough ear exam, thorough tests of your reflexes and
movement, hearing tests. During the hearing tests, your doctor may
place a tuning fork in the middle of your forehead, behind your ear,
or in front of your ear, and ask you about what you hear. Your doctor
may also whisper behind your ear and ask what you hear.

Excessive Drinking (Water)
What it feels like: believing that you drink and urinate more than
you should.
What can make it worse:drinking alcohol or coffee, taking diuret-
ics (“water pills”).
Although it seems obvious, it’s important to remember that drinking
more than usual will cause you to urinate more than usual. Adults
produce an average of 1.5 liters — about 1.5 quarts — of urine per
day, and typically do not need to wake up in the middle of the night
to urinate unless they drank coffee, alcohol, or a lot of fluids before
bed. If you are urinating more frequently than usual, but not pro-
ducing more than the average amount, you may have a urinary tract
infection or a condition that obstructs the flow of urine. See chapter
on Urine Problems for more information.
Toddlers who are being toilet trained often have to urinate frequently
and urgently.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about: anxiety, depression,
headaches, breathing difficulties when lying down, pain or difficulty
urinating, fever, chills, dribbling or change in the force of urine
stream, excessive urination at night, excessive eating, swelling in
your extremities.
Your doctor will want to know if you or anyone in your family
has had any of these conditions: diabetes, anxiety, depression,
nervous system disease, brain surgery or skull fractures, kidney dis-
ease, urinary tract infections, prostate disease, cardiovascular dis-
ease, liver disease.

you urinate each day, and how often you have to get up in the
middle of the night to urinate.
Your doctor will want to know if you’re taking any of these med-
ications:diuretics (“water pills”), insulin, or other medications for
diabetes.
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the fol-

Eye Problems
What it feels like:varies from eye pain to double, poor, or blurred
vision.
What can make it worse:looking in a particular direction, wearing
contact lenses, eye injury, the presence of an object in the eye.
Important: Never try to remove a foreign object that may be deeply
imbedded in the eye. If you have exposed your eyes to chemicals,
make sure to wash them out thoroughly before doing anything else.
If you are experiencing sudden blindness or eye injury, seek medical
attention as soon as possible.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about:blurry or loss of vision, eye
pain, eye redness or discharge, intolerance to light, double vision,
tearing, dryness, irritation, or swelling in the eyelid, seeing halos
around lights, headache, the date of your last eye exam, protuberance
of eyes, trouble speaking, steadiness on feet, any other changes in
movement or your senses.
If you are experiencing double vision, your doctor will want to
know if the double vision is occurring in one or both eyes, if you
see it everywhere you look, if it is constant, when it began, and
whether its onset coincided with injury to the head or eye.
Your doctor will want to know if you or anyone in your family has
had any of these conditions: thyroid disease, diabetes, high blood
pressure, nervous system disease, heart disease, previous eye disease,
migraine headaches, allergies, glaucoma, “cross-eyes,” “wall-eyes.”
Your doctor will want to know if you have been exposed to any
dust, metal work, or toxins, such as wood alcohol or smog.

Frostbite
What it feels like: numbness or pain after exposing part of your
body to extreme cold.
What can make it worse: having had the exposed area wet while
also cold.
What can make it better:removing the exposed area from the cold.
If your skin has been exposed to the extreme cold for a long period
of time, and appears hard, pale, and insensitive to touch, you may
have frostbite. While thawing, your skin may become red and
painful.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about:how many previous tetanus
shots you have received, and if the exposed area is numb, blue, white,
or painful.
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the fol-
lowing:thorough skin exam, to check the extent of frostbite and how
well you can feel in the exposed area.
Skin that is white and insensitive to touch may be severely frost-
bitten. If you believe you have experienced severe frostbite, seek
medical help immediately. If help is not readily available, place
affected areas in warm—not hot—water, or cover them in warm
cloths for 20 to 30 minutes. Wrap the affected areas in sterile dress-
ing, try to keep them immobile, and drink lots of fluids. Allowing the
areas to refreeze could be very dangerous, so only begin the thawing
process if you are sure the area can be constantly kept warm.

Gait-Coordination Problems
What it feels like:varies from limping, tremor, or weakness to lack
of coordination.
What can make it worse: darkness, trying to rise from a seated
position.
People can feel unsteady on their feet if they experience dizziness
when standing up. See chapter on Dizziness for more information.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about:headache, tinnitus, weakness
or changes in sensation, tremor, joint, back, neck, or leg pain.
Your doctor will want to know if you or anyone in your family
has had any of these conditions:alcoholism, diabetes, any nervous
system disease, chronic anemia, syphilis, cerebrovascular disease,
cerebral palsy, arthritis or joint disease, hip disease, abnormal gait or
coordination.
Your doctor will want to know if you’re taking any of these med-
ications: barbiturates, tranquilizers, anticonvulsants such as
Dilantin.
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the follow-
ing: blood pressure, checking muscle strength, watching you walk,
testing your strength, sensation, and reflexes. If the patient is a child,
your doctor may measure her range of motion in the hip and the
length of her legs, and may ask her to stand on one foot or make a
simple drawing.

Mental Delays (Child)
What it feels like: the child does not exhibit mental skills seen in
children of similar ages; also known as mental retardation.
What can make it worse: asking the child to look at or listen to
something, emotional upset.
Not every healthy child develops at the same pace, and it is difficult
to determine if a child is mentally developing normally during the
first few months of life. Most children who initially appear to be
“slow starters” eventually catch up to their peers.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask about the child: abnormal hearing,
trouble seeing, difficult behavior, convulsions, disturbances in sensa-
tion or movement, results of tests of reading, vision, and hearing.
Your doctor will want to know if the child or anyone in the
child’s family has had any of these conditions:prematurity, con-
vulsions at birth, deformities, low Apgar score, jaundice.
Your doctor may also ask if the child’s mother experienced any
of the following conditions during pregnancy:rash, lymph node
enlargement, German measles, unusually long or short labor, pro-
longed anesthesia, blood infections.
Your doctor will want to know when the child first began to
appear “delayed,” and the nature of the delays.
Your doctor will ask you if the child has been eating lead paint
or dirt, and the nature of the child’s family life.
Your doctor will want to know if the child is taking any
medications.

146 MENTALDELAYS(CHILD)
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the fol-
lowing: checking for the presence of certain development mile-
stones, measuring head circumference, height, weight, checking ears,
thorough eye exam, pushing on the abdomen.
Important factors to consider when visiting a doctor to ask
about a child’s mental delays:
•
The only person who should diagnose a child with mental retar-
dation is an expert in developmental neurology.
•
Before diagnosing a child as mentally retarded, your doctor will
conduct a number of tests of different aspects of mental func-
tionat regular intervals.
•
Most cases of mental retardation involve delays in one area of
mental function. Multiple types of delays in one child may be
the result of environmental problems, such as child abuse, neg-
lect, or changes in school. Certain diseases can also produce
multiple delays, including muscle disease, poor vision, and nerv-
ous system disease.
•
The following factors are associated with a higher risk of men-
tal delays in children:
•
Rubelladuring the first 12 weeks or blood infectionsdur-
ing any stage of the mother’s pregnancy
•
Being born with yellowing skin (see chapter on Yellow
Skin; this condition is often normal), seizures, a low
Apgar score (the number given by the doctor when the
baby is born that tells how well she is breathing and how
well her heart is beating), cerebral palsy, Down syndrome,
prematurity
•
Infantile hypothyroidism, in which the infant’s thyroid
gland is not sufficiently active; symptoms of hypothy-
roidism in an infant include increasing weight relative to
height, yellow skin, thick tongue, and slow development

Mouth Trouble
What it feels like:varies from pain to bleeding to trouble swallowing.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about:growths in the mouth, foul-
smelling breath, sore or bleeding gums, recent skin abnormalities,
common cold, difficulty talking, difficulty swallowing, sounds heard
while breathing, excessive alcohol drinking, toothache, facial pain,
salivation problems, fever, unpleasant taste.
Your doctor will want to know if you or anyone in your family
has had any of these conditions: diabetes, syphilis, alcoholism,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Your doctor will want to know if you smoke, wear dentures,
brush and floss your teeth regularly, and if you have recently
come in contact with a person who has strep throat.
Your doctor will want to know if you’re taking any of these med-
ications:diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin), antibiotics, steroids.
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the fol-
lowing: temperature, mouth exam, throat exam, checking lymph
nodes for swelling.

Sleep Problems
What it feels like:having trouble falling asleep, or waking up early
in the morning, before you have fully rested.
What can make it worse:drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages,
smoking, stress, being inactive.
The amount of sleep people need varies, but typically falls between 7 and
8 hours each night. People experience two types of sleep—deep sleep and
lighter sleep, when they dream. As people age, they tend to spend less
time in deep sleep, perhaps explaining why older people often wake up
several times each night and are considered “light sleepers.”
Some cases of sleep problems occur for simple reasons, such as inac-
tivity or boredom, leading you to take naps and therefore struggle to
sleep at night.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about:daytime napping, loud snor-
ing, needing to urinate in the middle of the night, anxiety, depression,
pains in muscles, chest pain, joint pain, results of interventions you
have tried to improve your sleep.
Your doctor will want to know if you or anyone in your family
has had any of these conditions:lung disease, heart disease.
Your doctor will want to know when you began to have trouble
sleeping, and how many hours of interrupted sleep you typical-
ly get each night.
Your doctor will want to know if you’re taking any of these med-
ications: diuretics (“water pills”), asthma medications, sedatives,
tranquilizers, antidepressants.

Small Baby
What it appears like:a baby is relatively small for his or her age.
Most small babies are genetically small, meaning many of their fam-
ily members were similarly small when younger. See below for other,
less frequent causes of small size in babies.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about: cough, breathing trouble,
trouble exercising, bluish or purplish discoloration of the skin, trou-
ble eating, smelly and greasy bowel movements, vomiting, constipa-
tion, diarrhea, fever, behavior problems, tiredness, how long the baby
has been small, birth weight, birth height, the baby’s growth pattern,
any recent changes in growth, weight before and after breast-feeding.
Your doctor will want to know if the baby or anyone in the baby’s
family has had any of these conditions:any chronic disease, past
serious illnesses that have since been “cured,” exposure to HIV, small
stature, cystic fibrosis, kidney disease.
Your doctor may ask about the baby’s dietary history and family
life, such as whether there have been any recent births, deaths,
or hospitalizations.
Your doctor will want to know if the baby is taking any medica-
tions.
Your doctor will do a physical examination of the baby, includ-
ing the following: weight, height, head size, temperature, pulse,

If your swelling can be described as a “lump,”and is located in your
neck, under your jaw, around your ears, above your collarbone,
under your arms, behind your knees and elbows, or in your groin, the
lump is likely a swollen lymph node.
Swollen lymph nodes can occur because of injuries or diseases
such as those affecting the mouth, teeth, or lungs.
Your Doctor Visit
What your doctor will ask you about:weight change, shortness of
breath, yellowing of skin, itching, tenderness, redness, or aching in
swollen area, chronic loose stools, abdominal pain, chills, pain,

Lumps and swelling in lymph nodes are often harmless and pose no danger. Lymph
nodes often swell as a result of problems in nearby regions of the body. For instance,
swollen nodes in the neck are often a response to dental cavities or other oral prob-
lems, while lymph nodes in the thigh or groin can swell in response to infections in
the foot, leg, or groin.

116 HEARTBURN
Your doctor will do a physical examination including the fol-
lowing: blood pressure, pulse, pushing on the abdomen, checking
stool for the presence of blood.
Some important factors to consider with ulcers caused by heartburn:
•
Ulcers are caused by the movement of stomach acid up into and
through the esophagus, which connects the throat to the stom-
ach. Over time, this movement of acid can lead to ulcer, or irri-
tation of the stomach or intestinal lining.
•
Ulcers frequently recur. To keep this from happening, your doc-
tor may ask you to:
•
Limit your intake of caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol,and cer-
tain medications.
•
Stick to your treatment plan once you experience any
symptoms.
•
Report any signs that you may be experiencing gastroin-
testinal bleeding, such as overly dark stools, vomiting
blood, or weakness when standing.
•
If, after avoiding the factors listed under “What can make it
worse,” you still have pain, your doctor may perform some
additional diagnostic tests to understand your problem.
•
Some ulcers are caused by bacteria, so your doctor may
give you antibioticsto cure your ulcers.
