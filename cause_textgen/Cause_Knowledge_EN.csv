Acne,"Acne commonly develops when excess oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria accumulate in the pores. Hormonal shifts, stress, certain cosmetic products, diet, and genetics often worsen flare‑ups. Some medications or hormonal conditions can also trigger more persistent or severe acne."
Back pain,"Back pain frequently stems from muscle strain, ligament sprain, poor posture, long periods of sitting or standing, improper lifting technique, or sudden injury. Spinal disc problems, nerve compression, age-related degeneration, weak core muscles, and excess body weight can also contribute."
Blurry vision,"Blurry vision may result from refractive errors such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism, as well as dry eyes, screen overuse, infections, or inflammation. Sudden blurry vision may indicate more serious issues, including glaucoma, retinal blood flow problems, or complications from systemic diseases like diabetes."
Body feels weak,"A general sense of body weakness can arise from fatigue, poor sleep, dehydration, inadequate nutrition, anemia, infection, or emotional stress. Medical conditions such as thyroid disorders, heart disease, electrolyte imbalance, or chronic illness may also cause persistent weakness."
Cough,"A cough helps clear the airways of mucus, irritants, or foreign particles. It commonly occurs with respiratory infections, bronchitis, asthma, allergies, smoke exposure, pollution, or acid reflux. A long-lasting cough may be related to chronic lung disease or medication side effects."
Ear ache,"Ear pain often occurs due to infections of the middle or outer ear, hardened earwax, irritation from water or foreign objects, or pressure changes. Respiratory infections, jaw tension, or dental problems can also radiate pain to the ear area."
Emotional pain,"Emotional pain may arise from significant stress, grief, trauma, relationship difficulties, or prolonged psychological strain. Conditions like anxiety, depression, burnout, or adjustment disorders may intensify emotional distress."
Feeling cold,"Feeling unusually cold may be related to environmental exposure, fatigue, low body fat, or insufficient clothing. Medically, it can be associated with anemia, hypothyroidism, circulatory issues, low blood sugar, or malnutrition. Certain medications or psychological factors may also affect temperature sensitivity."
Feeling dizzy,"Dizziness may be caused by inner-ear balance disorders, low blood pressure, dehydration, low blood sugar, anemia, anxiety, or fatigue. Vertigo—feeling like the room is spinning—commonly relates to vestibular system disturbances."
Foot ache,"Foot pain can result from poorly fitting shoes, extended standing or walking, muscle or ligament strain, or structural issues such as flat feet or plantar fasciitis. Conditions like gout, arthritis, neuropathy, or circulation problems may also contribute."
Hair falling out,"Hair loss may be linked to genetics, hormonal fluctuations, thyroid problems, stress, nutritional deficiencies, harsh hair treatments, or medication side effects. Autoimmune disorders or scalp infections can cause more severe shedding."
Hard to breath,"Difficulty breathing can occur due to asthma, bronchitis, lung infections, allergies, or chronic lung disease. Other causes include heart conditions, anemia, anxiety or panic attacks, obesity, or exposure to pollutants or smoke."
Head ache,"Headaches often arise from muscle tension, stress, poor sleep, dehydration, or eye strain. Migraines may be triggered by hormonal shifts, certain foods, lack of rest, or sensory overstimulation. In rare cases, headaches may signal infection, bleeding, or increased intracranial pressure."
Heart hurts,"Chest discomfort can originate from muscle strain, rib or joint inflammation, or nerve irritation. Acid reflux, anxiety, and panic attacks can also create chest tightness. Some cases may relate to reduced blood flow to the heart or other serious cardiac conditions."
Infected wound,"An infected wound develops when bacteria enter through broken skin. Poor wound hygiene, trapped foreign objects, deep or contaminated wounds, and weak immune function increase infection risk. Redness, swelling, worsening pain, pus, and fever may indicate infection."
Injury from sports,"Sports injuries commonly occur due to repetitive motion, improper technique, insufficient warm‑up, direct impact, or sudden increases in training intensity. Sprains, strains, ligament tears, tendon injuries, and bruises are frequent outcomes."
Internal pain,"Internal pain refers to discomfort in areas such as the abdomen, chest, or pelvis. Causes vary widely and may involve organ inflammation, infection, digestive issues, kidney or gallstones, or circulatory problems."
Joint pain,"Joint pain may arise from inflammation (arthritis), wear‑and‑tear (osteoarthritis), injury, repetitive strain, or infection. Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and metabolic disorders like gout can cause severe or recurring joint pain."
Knee pain,"Knee pain may result from ligament injuries, cartilage damage, meniscus tears, inflammation, overuse, age-related degeneration, or excess body weight. High-impact activity and past injuries can increase susceptibility."
Muscle pain,"Muscle pain often stems from overuse, intense exercise, muscle tension, or poor posture. Viral infections, electrolyte imbalances, dehydration, or certain medications may cause widespread muscle discomfort."
Neck pain,"Neck pain frequently arises from poor posture, prolonged screen time, awkward sleeping positions, or muscle tension from stress. Degenerative changes, nerve compression, or whiplash injuries may also contribute."
Open wound,"Open wounds occur due to cuts, scrapes, punctures, or blunt trauma. The depth of the wound, environmental cleanliness, and quality of initial care influence infection risk and healing speed."
Shoulder pain,"Shoulder pain often relates to inflammation or injury of the muscles, tendons, or ligaments around the joint. Repetitive overhead motion, poor sleeping posture, sports injuries, or frozen shoulder can lead to pain and restricted movement."
Skin issue,"Skin issues may stem from allergies, irritation, bacterial or fungal infections, or autoimmune conditions. Climate, sweat, friction, and hygiene habits can influence symptoms."
Stomach ache,"Stomach pain may result from gastritis, digestive infections, gas buildup, intestinal cramps, food intolerance, constipation, or diarrhea. Irregular eating patterns, spicy foods, stress, or more serious abdominal conditions may play a role."
