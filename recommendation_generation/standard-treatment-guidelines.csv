disease,treatment
FEVER,"Treatment
Routine use of antipyretics in low-grade fever is not justified. This may mask important clinical
indications. However, in acute febrile illnesses suggestive of viral or bacterial cause, fever
should be treated.
Non pharmacological treatment
Hydrotherapy and rest
Pharmacological treatment
Non-specific
 Tab. paracetamol 500-1000 mg 6-8 hourly. Or Tab. ibuprofen 400-600 mg 8 hourly.
Specific
 Antibiotics/antimalarials depending upon the cause suggested by clinical and laboratory
evaluation.
Outcome
In most cases of fever, patient may either recover spontaneously or a diagnosis is reached after
repeated clinical evaluation and investigations. If no diagnosis is reached in up to 3 weeks,
patient is said to be having fever of unknown origin (FUO) and should be managed accordingly.
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Avoid covering the patient having high fever with blanket etc.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in cool environment. Cold sponging of face and limbs
should bedone repeatedly.

FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO),"Treatment
Sometimes evaluation may need discontinuation of all drugs being taken by the patient to rule
out drug fever as the cause of FUO.
Symptomatic treatment for fever (for details see section on fever)
12
Common Conditions
 Cold sponging may be done if fever produces discomfort. The emphasis in patients with
classic FUO is on continued observation and examination.
 (Caution: Avoid 'shotgun' trials. Empirical therapies consisting of therapeutic trials
commonly used in patients with FUO are: antibiotics, anti-tubercular treatment (ATT)
and corticosteroids).
 The ability of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs to mask fever while permitting the spread of
infection dictates that their use should be avoided unless infection has been largely ruled
out.
 If on the basis of clinical evaluation and inability to reach a definitive diagnosis, a
therapeutic trial is started, the following principles must be kept in mind:
- Give only one set of trial at a given time
- The doses of drugs and period of therapeutic trial must be adequate-
- The patient must be followed closely for response
Patient education
 Self medication should be avoided.
 Antibiotics should be taken only on advice of a physician.
 Plenty of fluids should be taken. Stay in a cool environment."
ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER,"treatment
 Bed rest for two weeks followed by gradual ambulation
Pharmacological treatment
 Tab. penicillin V 500 mg BD for 10 days or Inj. benzathine penicillin G- 1.2 million
units in single does or Tab. erythromycin 250 mg QID for 10 days – if patient is allergic
to penicillin.
 For secondary prophylaxis for rheumatic fever, give Inj. benzathine penicillin 1.2 million
units every 3 weeks or Tab. penicillin V 250 mg BD daily or Tab. erythromycin 250 mg
twice daily.
 Duration of prophylaxis is given in Table 1.
13
Common Conditions
Table 1. Duration of secondary prophylaxis in acute rheumatic fever
Category of Patient Duration of Prophylaxis
For 5 years after the last attack or 21 years of
Rheumatic fever without carditis
age (whichever is longer).
Rheumatic fever with carditis but no For 10 years after the last attack, or 21 years of
residual valvular disease age (whichever is longer).
Rheumatic fever with persistent valvular For 10 years after the last attack, or 40 years of
disease, evident clinically or on age (whichever is longer). Sometimes lifelong
echocardiography prophylaxis may be required.
 Arthritis: Tab. aspirin 2 g QID in adults and 80-100 mg/kg/day in children till symptoms
persist or Tab. naproxen: 10-20 mg/kg/day can also be used.
 Carditis: Tab. prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day can be used for short periods or up to a
maximum of 3 weeks.
 Chorea: It occurs as a long term sequelae (3-6 months). Carbamazepine or sodium
valproate is preferred to haloperidol (0.05 mg/kg/day) to reduce the abnormal movements
but response may take up to 2 weeks. Treatment should continue up to 1-2 weeks after
symptoms subside."
ANAEMIA,"treatment
Iron deficiency anaemia
 Treat the underlying cause: menorrhagia in women, gastrointestinal blood loss in all age
groups including hookworm infestation, dietary deficiency, rarely malabsorption.
 Tab. ferrous sulfate 200 mg 3 times a day.
 Reduce the dose as haemoglobin rises to over 10 g/dl. Once haemoglobin is normal,
continue with 1 tablet daily for at least three months.
 Other preparations of iron are not superior, but they can be tried if patient does not find
ferrous sulfate suitable. These include ferrous fumarate and ferrous gluconate. The rate of
rise of haemoglobin should be 1 g/dl per week.
 If this does not occur, consider ongoing blood loss, noncompliance, and associated
haemoglobinopathy like thalassaemia carrier status, malabsorption, or an incorrect
diagnosis.
 Parenteral iron does not lead to a faster rise in haemoglobin. It is indicated in the
following situations: (i) malabsorption of iron, (ii) intolerance of oral iron, (iii) in late
pregnancy to ensure that foetal stores of iron are replenished rapidly, (iv) if ongoing
blood loss exceeds the capacity to absorb oral iron (like in inoperable malignancy) and (v)
in noncompliant patient. There is danger of anaphylactoid reactions; hence facilities to
manage these should be readily available.
Folic acid deficiency
 Treat the cause: Dietary deficiency, increased requirement as in pregnancy and children,
haemolytic anaemia.
 Tab. folic acid 5 mg daily. This dose is adequate even in malabsorption syndrome.
Vitamin B deficiency
12
15
Common Conditions
 Treat the cause: Dietary deficiency in vegetarians, pernicious anaemia. Although
uncommon, it is also under diagnosed due to lack of facilities.
 Tab. vitamin B complex, as in haematinic tablets. Or Inj. B 1000 mcg IM, one injection
12
on alternate days for total 5 injections, then once a week for 5 weeks, then once in 3 to 6
months will be adequate for most patients.
Patient education
 Educate the patient about preventive measures for worm infestation.
 Inform about importance of taking adequate food with green leafy vegetables to meet the
nutritional requirement.
 Cooking food in iron utensils may increase iron content in the diet.
 Instruct the patient to take iron tablets after food; iron tablets sometimes produce stomach
upset.
 Inform the patient that the stools could turn black during iron therapy
 Reduce the dose of iron if it produces stomach ache, diarrhoea or constipation.
 Explain that the response to iron therapy is gradual and it takes weeks or months for
blood to become normal. Continue iron tablets for six months.
 Keep iron tablets out of the reach of children. They may swallow the tablets as candies
causing adverse reactions including death."
TYPHOID FEVER,"treatment
 Most patients with uncomplicated enteric fever can be managed at home with oral
antibiotics and antipyretics.
16
Common Conditions
 Patients with persistent vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal distension should be
hospitalized and given supportive therapy as well as a parenteral third-generation
cephalosporin or fluoroquinolone, depending on the susceptibility profile (Table 2).
 Therapy should be administered for at least 10 days or for 5 days after fever resolution.

 The 1–5% of patients who develop chronic carriage of Salmonella can be treated for 4–6
weeks with an appropriate oral antibiotic.
 Treatment with oral amoxicillin, cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or norfloxacin is 80%
effective in eradicating chronic carriage of susceptible organisms.
 However, in cases of anatomic abnormality (e.g., biliary or kidney stones), eradication
often requires both antibiotic therapy and surgical correction.

DENGUE,"treatment
 Bed rest is advisable during the acute phase.
 Use cold sponging to keep temperature below 39ºC
Pharmacological treatment
 Management ofdengue fever is symptomatic and supportive
 Antipyretics may be used to lower the body temperature. Aspirin/NSAIDs like ibuprofen
etc should be avoided since it may cause gastritis, vomiting, acidosis and platelet
dysfunction.
 Paracetamol is preferable in the doses as follows: 1-2 years: 60 –120 mg/doses, 3-6 years:
120 mg/dose,7-12 years: 240 mg/dose,Adult : 500mg/dose
Note: In children the dose is calculated as per 10mg/kg body weight per dose which can
be repeated at the interval of 6 hrs.
 Oral fluid and electrolyte therapy are recommended for patients with excessive sweating
or vomiting.
 Patients should be monitored in DHF endemic area until they become afebrile for one
day without the use of antipyretics and after platelet and haematocrit determinations are
stable, platelet count is more than 50,000/mm3.
Management of Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (Febrile Phase)
 The management of febrile phase is similar to that of DF.
 Paracetamol is recommended to keep the temperature below 39OC. Copious amount of
fluid should be given orally, to the extent the patient tolerates, oral hydration solution
(ORS), such as those used for the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases and/or fruit juices are
preferable to plain water
22
Common Conditions
 IV fluid may be administered if the patient is vomiting persistently or refusing to feed.
 Patients should be closely monitored for the initial signs of shock. The critical period is
during the transition from the febrile to the afebrile stage and usually occurs after the
third day of illness.
 Serial haematocrit determinations are essential guide for treatment, since they reflect the
degree of plasma leakage and need for intravenous administration of fluids.
 Haematocrit should be determined daily from the third day until the temperature has
remained normal for one or two days. If haematocrit determination is not possible,
haemoglobin determination may be carried out as an alternative.
 The details of IV treatment when required for patients are given in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Treatment algorithm of dengue
23
Common Conditions
Management of DHF Grade I and Grade II:
 Any person who has dengue fever with thrombocytopenia and haemoconcentration and
presents with abdominal pain, black tarry stools, epistaxis, bleeding from the gums and
infection etc needs to be hospitalized.
 All these patients should be observed for signs of shock. The critical period for
development of shock is transition from febrile to abferile phase of illness, which usually
occurs after third day of illness.
 A rise of haemoconcentration indicates need for IV fluid therapy. If despite the treatment,
the patient develops fall in BP, decrease in urine output or other features of shock, the
management for Grade III/IV DHF/DSS should be instituted.
 Oral rehydration should be given along with antipyretics like paracetamol sponging, etc.
as described above.
 The detailed treatment for patient with DHF Grade I and II is given at Figure 5. Common
signs of complications are observed during the afebrile phase of DHF. Immediately after
hospitalization, the haematocrit, platelet count and vital signs should be examined to
assess the patient’s condition and intravenous fluid therapy should be started. The patient
requires regular and sustained monitoring.
Figure 5. Volume replacement flow chart for patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever
grade I and II
24
Common Conditions
Fluid requirement
 The volume of fluid required to be replaced should be just sufficient to maintain effective
circulation during the period of plasma leakage. To ensure adequate fluid replacement
and avoid over-fluid infusion, the rate of intravenous fluid should be adjusted throughout
the 24 to 48 hour period of plasma leakage by periodic haematocrit determinations and
assessment of vital signs.
 The required regimen of fluid should be calculated on the basis of body weight and
charted on a 1-3 hourly basis, or more frequently in the case of shock. The flow of fluid
and the time of infusion are dependent on the severity of DHF. The schedule given below
is a guideline and calculated for moderate dehydration of about 6% deficit (plus
maintenance) (Table 5).
Table 5. Fluid requirement as per body weight of the patient
Weight on Fluid requirement/kg body
admission (kg) weight/day (ml/kg)
<7 220
7-11 165
12-18 130
>18 90
 In older children who weigh more than 40 kg, the volume needed for 24 hours should be
calculated as twice that required for maintenance (using the Holiday and Segar formula).
The maintenance fluid should be calculated as follows:
Table 6. Maintenance fluid requirement according to Holiday and Segar formula
Body weight in kg Maintenance volume for 24 hours
<10kg 100 ml / kg
10-20kg 1000+50 ml / kg
>20kg 1500+20 ml / kg
For a child weighing 40 kgs, the maintenance is: 1500 + (20x20) = 1900 ml. This means that
the child requires 3800 ml IV fluid during 24 hours.
Indications of red cell transfusion
 Loss of blood (overt blood) -10% or more of total blood volume
 Preferably whole blood/ component to be used
 Refractory shock despite adequate fluid administration and declining haematocrit -
replacement volume should be 10 ml/kg body wt at a time and coagulogram should be
done.
25
Common Conditions
 If fluid overload is present,PCV is to be given
Indications of platelet transfusion
 In general there is no need to give prophylactic platelets even at less than 20,000
cells/mm3.
 Prophylactic platelet transfusion may be given at level of less than 10,000 cells/mm3 in
absence of bleeding manifestations.
 Prolonged shock; with coagulopathy and abnormal coagulogram.
 In case of systemic massive bleeding, platelet transfusion may be needed in addition to
red cell transfusion."
CHIKUNGUNYA,"treatment
 Mild exercises and physiotherapy may be suggested in recovering persons.
 Exposure to warm environment may be suggested
 Non weight bearing exercises
 Surgery in severely damaged joints
Pharmacological treatment
 Acute stage of illness
 Treat symptomatically (Tab. paracetamol 1 gm 3-4 times a day for fever, headache and
pain.)
 Avoid aspirin and steroid because of risk of GI side effects and Reye’s syndrome with
aspirin.
 Tab. hydroxychloroquinine 200mg orally once daily or Tab. chloroquinine phosphate
300mg per day for a period of 4 weeks in cases where arthralgia is refractory to other
drugs.
 Sideeffects of hydroxychloroquinine include retinal damage andelevated liver enzymes.

Pediatric cases are to be treated under RNTCP with the same thrice weekly short course
chemotherapy regimens (“New” or “Previously treated”) given under Directly Observed
Treatment Short Course (DOTS) as for adult patients. They are to be registered in the
respective RNTCP TB Register. Pediatric patient-wise boxes are available with different
dosages under two weight bands for children weighing 6 to 10 kg and 11 to 17 kg.
Wherever possible, before a child is started on the “Previously Treated” regimen, she/he
should be examined by a pediatrician or TB expert.

PAS 150,"Treatment of XDR-TB (Category V)
All XDR-TB patients who are considered for category V regimen, will be screened by the
DOTS-Plus committee and if found suitable will be referred to a thoracic surgeon for
consideration of surgery to improve the treatment outcomes. Identification must be done for
the site (tertiary centres) with such surgical facilities.

6-12 months Cm, PAS, Mfx, High dose‐H, Cfz, Lzd, Amx/Clv
18 months PAS, Mfx, High dose‐H, Cfz, Lzd, Amx/Clv
The Category V treatment regimen consists of 7 drugs, with 2 reserve/substitute drugs.
The dosage of the drugs would vary as per the weight of the patient (≤ 45Kg or > 45Kg).
-
All drugs are to be given on a daily basis. Injections of capreomycin will be given for 6
days/week (not on Sundays).
37
Common Conditions
All morning doses are to be supervised by the DOT Provider except on Sundays. After
taking DOT for morning doses on Saturday, next day medicines would be given to the
-
patient to be taken at home on Sunday.
Empty blisters of medicines taken unsupervised in evening and on Sundays are to be
collected by DOT Provider.
-
The change from IP to CP will be done only after achievement of culture conversion i.e.
2 consecutive negative cultures taken at least one month apart. In case of delay in culture
-
conversion, the IP can be extended from 6 months up to a maximum of 12 months. In
case of extension, the DOTS – Plus site Committee, which will be responsible for
initiating and monitoring the Category V regimen, can decide on administering
capreomycin injection intermittently (3 times/week) for the months 7 to 12.

 HIV co-infection with TB
-
TB patients living with HIV should receive the same duration of TB treatment with
daily regimen as HIV negative TB patients.
-
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) must be offered to all patients with HIV and TB as well
as drug-resistant TB requiring second-line anti-TB drugs, irrespective of CD4 cell-
-
count, as early as possible (within the first 8 weeks) following initiation of anti-TB
treatment. Appropriate arrangements for access to antiretroviral drugs should be made
38
Common Conditions
for patients. However, initiation of treatment for TB should not be delayed. Patients
with TB and HIV infection should also receive co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis for
other infections.
People living with HIV should be screened for TB using four symptom complex
(current cough or, fever or weight loss or night sweats) at HIV care settings and those
-
with any of these symptoms should be evaluated for ruling out active TB. Such
patients in whom active TB is ruled out, Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) in the
dosage of10 mg/Kg body weight should be offered to them for 6 months.
 Adherence
Supervision and support should be individualized.
Ensuring Adherence in M/XDR TB patients: Patient support systems, including direct
-
observation of treatment, are required to ensure adherence. It should be ensured that
-
the patient consumes all the dosages of the drugs.
Trained treatment supporter for treatment adherence: Such measures may include
identification and training of a treatment supporter (for TB and, if appropriate, for
-
HIV, diabetes mellitus etc.) who is acceptable, accessible and accountable to the
patient and to the health system.
Information Communication Technology to promote treatment literacy and
adherence: Optimal use of Information Communication Technology (ICT) should be
-
done to promote treatment literacy and adherence
Other important points to remember
 Public Health Responsibility- Any practitioner treating a TB patient is assuming an
important public health responsibility to prevent ongoing transmission of the infection
and the development of drug resistance. To fulfill this responsibility the practitioner must
not only prescribe an appropriate regimen, but also utilize local public health services /
community health services, and other agencies including NGOs when necessary, to assess
the adherence of the patient and to address poor adherence when it occurs.
 Maintain Records for all TB patients: A written record of all medications given,
microbiological response and adverse reactions should be maintained for all patients.
Every patient’s clinical outcome should be recorded in the case register and available for
public health monitoring.
 Notification of TB Cases: All health establishments must report all TB cases and their
treatment outcomes to public health authorities (District Nodal Officer for Notification).
Proper feedback need to be ensured to all health care providers who"
EPILEPSY,"treatment

- Metabolic imbalances such as abnormal serum electrolytes and glucose, medications
(theophylline), illicit drug use (e.g., cocaine), structural CNS lesion such as a brain
tumor, vascular malformation, or brain abscess.

Pregnancy
 Most women with epilepsy who become pregnant will have an uncomplicated gestation
and deliver a normal baby. Since the potential harm of uncontrolled convulsive seizures
on the mother and fetus is considered greater than the teratogenic effects of antiepileptic
drugs, it is currently recommended that pregnant women be maintained on effective drug
therapy. Patients should take folic acid (1–4 mg/d), to prevent development of neural tube
defects.
Contraception
 Drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate can significantly
decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives via enzyme induction and other mechanisms.
Patients should be advised to consider alternative forms of contraception.

CARDIOPULMONARY RESUSCITATION,"management of these is essential to prevent CPA, the outcome of which is poor.
Diagnosis of cardiopulmonary and cardiac arrest
1. Absence of pulse in major arteries (carotid or femoral in older children and
femoral or brachial in infants as carotid is difficult to palpate due to short neck).
2. Absence of heart sounds on auscultation.
3. Asystole /ventricular fibrillation on ECG.
Respiratory arrest
Absence of respiration on examination (absent chest movements), listening (absent air flow on
bringing ears in front of mouth) and feeling (absent air flow on keeping hands in front of mouth
or nose).
Levels of CPR
Basic life support (BLS): The elements of CPR are provided without additional equipment.
Skill and speed are most essential.
Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS): Use of equipment and drugs for assisting ventilation
orcirculation.
Primary survey to assess the patient's condition:
 Tap the patient on the shoulder and ask, ""Are you all right?""
 If the patient does not respond, call for help.
 Give 2 minutes (5 cycles) of CPR before leaving patient to call for help.
 Check for pulse or any other signs of life; begin CPR, 30 compressions to 2 respirations
(push hard and fast--100/minute and release chest completely).
 Open airway and check for breathing. Give 2 breaths that make the chest rise.
 Start an IV line.
 Begin oxygen.
 Attach a monitor
 Intravenous / Intra osseous (IO) access is a priority over advanced airway management. If an
advanced airway is placed, change to continuous chest compressions without pauses for
breaths. Give 8 to 10 breaths per minute and check rhythm every 2 minutes.
47
Emergency Conditions"
ANAPHYLAXIS,"treatment depends on
prompt diagnosis and rapid supplementation of appropriate therapy.
Clinical criteria for diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following three criteria is fulfilled:
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal
tissue, or both (e.g., generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips/tongue/uvula)
with one of the following,
 Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnoea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced
peak expiratoryflow(PEF), hypoxemia)
 Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (e.g.
hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)
 Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue
 Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., cramping abdominal pain, vomiting) or
2. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen,
 Infants and children- low systolic blood pressure (age-specific) or greater than 30%
decrease in systolic blood pressure
 Adults- systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease
from baseline

Central nervous system
 Aura of impending doom, uneasiness (in infants and children, sudden behavioral change,
e.g. irritability, cessation of play, clinging to parent); throbbing
 Headache (pre-epinephrine), altered mental status, dizziness, confusion, tunnel vision
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove exposure to trigger if possible (discontinue intravenous diagnostic or therapeutic
agent that seems to triggering symptoms). Place the patient supine and elevate the
extremities.
 Observe vital signs frequently and if possible, monitor electrocardiogram and pulse
oximetry.
 For severe anaphylaxis with shock, initial management should be directed at the ABC of
resuscitation, namely maintenance of adequate airway - suction, breathing, and
circulation. If working alone, call for assistance.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. adrenaline 1:1000 (1mg/ml), 0.01 ml/kg (maximum 0.3 ml in children and 0.5 ml in
adults) IM (mid anterolateral aspect of thigh). If necessary, dose can be repeated every 15
minutes.
53
Emergency Conditions
 If the anaphylaxis is due to an allergen extract or to a hymenoptera sting into an
extremity, half the dose of adrenaline can be infiltrated locally, subcutaneously after
dilution with 2 ml saline.
 High flow oxygen (4-6 lit/min by face mask or oropharyngeal airway).
 Establish two wide bore intravenous lines. Commence rapid fluid resuscitation with Inj.
NS (0.9% normal saline) at rate of 5-10 ml/kg in 5 to 10 minutes. One to two litres of
fluid bolus can be given.
 Intubate and commence intermittent positive pressure ventilation if severe laryngeal
obstruction, bronchospasm, circulatory shock or coma.
 If no response to the initial intramuscular dose of adrenaline, administer adrenaline 5
mcg/kg slowly in to the intravenous line. Repeat at 5 minutes intervals depending on
response. If the patient remains in shock, start an adrenaline infusion (preferably via a
central venous line), commencing at 0.1 mcg/kg/min in children and 0.2 mcg/kg/min in
adults with titration required to restore blood pressure. Large doses of adrenaline may
be needed.
 Commence cardiopulmonary resuscitation, if necessary.
 If the only manifestation of anaphylaxis is urticaria or angioedema, initial IM dose of
adrenaline should be given in addition to antagonists. If no other manifestation, patient
can be kept under observation for at least 12 hours and then discharged.
Additional measures
 IV infusion of chlorpheniramine 10 mg (adult), 2.5-5 mg (child) or diphenhydramine 25-
50 mg (adult) (1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg [child]).
 Inj. salbutamol solution, 2.5 to 5 mg/3 ml given by nebulizer and face mask.
 IV hydrocortisone infusion 200 mg (adult), maximum 100 mg (child); or
methylprednisolone 50-100 mg (adult); 1 mg/kg, maximum 50 mg (child).
Supportive treatment
All patients with severe anaphylactic reaction must be hospitalized. Patients who remain
clinically unstable after initial resuscitation should be admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).
Patients respondingto the initial treatment should be observed for possible late reaction.

SHOCK,"treatment it may-lead to decompensated shock.
 Decompensated shock - There is fall in blood pressure and cardiac output. Features of
peripheral poor perfusion are compounded with manifestations of vital organ impairment.
Patient may have alteration of mentation (impaired cerebral perfusion), oliguria (renal
hypoperfusion) and myocardial ischaemia (coronary flow impairment). Patient has
acrocyanosis, cold and damp extremities and a pale look. If untreated, progress to
irreversible state of shock.
 Irreversible shock is a term applied to the clinical situation in which even
haemodynamic correction does not halt the progressive organ failure.
56
Emergency Conditions
Salient features
 Tachycardia, blood pressure may be normal or elevated due to compensatory
mechanisms, later falls as cardiovascular compensation fails. Neck veins may be
distended or flattened, depending on the etiology of shock. Decreased coronary
perfusion pressures can lead to ischemia, decreased ventricular compliance, and
increased left ventricular diastolic pressure and pulmonary edema.
 Tachypnea, increased minute ventilation, and increased dead space are common.
Bronchospasm, hypocapnia with progression to respiratory failure, and adult
respiratory distress syndrome can be seen.
 Skin pale, dusky, clammy skin with cyanosis, sweating, altered temperature, and
decreased capillary refill, oliguria.
Treatment
 Start oxygen 4-6 L/min
 Airway control, endotracheal intubation
 Adequate venous access. Large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters for adequate fluid
resuscitation. Central venous access may be necessary for monitoring and employing
pulmonary artery catheters, venous pacemakers, and long-term vasopressor therapy.
 Volume replacement. Isotonic, intravenous crystalloid fluids (0.9% NaCl, Ringer’s
lactate) are preferred for the initial resuscitation phase. Initial bolus volume is 20 to 40
ml/kg over 10 to 20 min (rapid infusion). Colloids (dextran, hetastarch, etc.) can be used
till blood is available.
 Blood is the ideal resuscitative fluid for hemorrhagic shock or in the presence of
significant anemia. Fully cross-matched blood is preferred, but if more rapid intervention
is required, type specific or type O negative blood may be employed. The decision to use
platelets or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) should be based on evidence of impaired
hemostasis and on frequent monitoring of coagulation parameters. Platelets are generally
given if there is ongoing hemorrhage and the platelet count is 50,000 or less; FFP is
indicated if the prothrombin time is prolonged more than 1.5 times.
 Vasopressors should be used if there is persistent hypotension after adequate volume
resuscitation. Inj. dobutamine 2.0 to 20.0 µg/kg/min for systolic BP over 100 mmHg,
dopamine 2.5 to 20.0 µg/kg/min for systolic BP 70 to 100 mmHg, and Inj. norepinephrine
0.5 to 30.0 µg/min for systolic BP under 70 mmHg.
 Acidosis should be treated with adequate ventilation and fluid resuscitation. Use of
sodium bicarbonate (1 meq/kg) is controversial. If it is used, it is given only in the setting
of severe acidosis refractory to ventilation and fluid resuscitation.
 Early surgical or medical consultation for admission or transfer as indicated.
57
Emergency Conditions
Monitoring
Special care in ICU should be taken by careful and continuous monitoring of BP, pulse rate
and respiratory rate, urine output and mental status frequently. Sedated patients should be
allowed to awaken (""drug holiday"") daily to assess their neurologic status and to shorten
duration of ventilator support.
Management guidelines for common causes of shock
Hemorrhagic Shock
 Ensure adequate ventilation/oxygenation
 Provide immediate control of hemorrhage (e.g., traction for long bone fractures, direct
pressure)
 Initiate judicious infusion of isotonic crystalloid solution (10–20 ml/kg) or colloid
solution
 With evidence of poor organ perfusion and 30-minute anticipated delay to hemorrhage
control, begin packed red bloodcell (PRBC) infusion (5–10 ml/kg)
 Treat coincident dysrhythmias (e.g., atrial fibrillation with synchronized cardioversion)
Cardiogenic Shock
 Ameliorate increased work of breathing; provide oxygen and positive end-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) for pulmonaryedema
 Begin vasopressor or inotropic support; Inj. norepinephine (0.5 µg/min) and Inj.
dobutamine (5 µg/kg/min)
 Seek to reverse the insult (e.g., initiate thrombolysis, arrange percutaneous transluminal
angioplasty)
 Consider intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation for refractory shock
Septic Shock
 Ensure adequate oxygenation
 Administer 20 ml/kg of crystalloid (0.9% normal saline or RL) or 5 ml/kg of colloid
(hemaccel or hetastarch), and titrate infusion to adequate central venous pressure and
urine output
 Begin antimicrobial therapy; attempt surgical drainage or débridement
 Begin packed RBC infusion for hemoglobin < 8 g/dL
 If volume restoration fails to improve organ perfusion, begin vasopressor support; initial
choice includes dopamine infusion at 5–15 µg/kg/min"
FLUIDANDELECTROLYTE IMBALANCE AND REPLACEMENT (IN ADULTS),"Treatment
The first principle is to restore circulating volume through infusion of intravenous fluids.
Once this is satisfactorily achieved, disturbances in electrolytes and acid-base balance if
present need to be rectified. Various fluids used for volume replacement are given below:
Replacement fluids
 Replacement fluids are used to replace abnormal loss of blood, plasma or other
extracellular fluids as first line treatment for hypovolemia in:
- Patients with established hypovolemia e.g. haemorrhagic shock.
- Maintenance of normovolaemia in patients with ongoing fluid losses e.g. surgical
blood loss.
 Intravenous replacement fluids are the first line of treatment for hypovolemia.
 Crystalloid maintenance fluids, which contain dextrose, are not suitable for use as
replacement fluids. However, crystalloid solutions with a similar concentration of
sodium to plasma (normal saline or balanced salt) solutions (Ringer's lactate or
Hartmann's solutions) are effective as replacement fluids. These should be available in
all hospitals where intravenous replacement fluids are used. Crystalloids should be
infused in a volume at least three times the volume lost in order to correct hypovolemia.
 All colloid solutions (albumins, dextran, gelatins and hydroxyethyl starch solutions) are
replacement fluids. However, they have not been shown to be superior to crystalloids in
resuscitation. Colloid solutions should be infused in a volume equal to the blood
volume deficit.
 Plasma should never be used as a replacement fluid.
 Plain water should never be infused intravenously as it can cause haemolysis.
59
Emergency Conditions
 In addition to the intravenous route, the intraosseous, oral, rectal or subcutaneous routes
can be used for the administration of fluids, blood and certain drugs. However, with the
exception of intraosseous route, other routes are generally unsuitable in severely
hypovolemic patients.
 Rectal fluids are administered through a plastic or rubber enema tube which is inserted
into the rectum and connected to a bag or bottle of fluid. A safe and effective solution
for a rectal rehydration is 1 liter of clean drinking water with teaspoon of table salt.
 Subcutaneous fluids can be used when other route of administration of fluids are
unavailable. A cannula or needle is inserted into the subcutaneous tissue (the abdominal
wall is a preferred site) and sterile fluids are administered in a conventional manner. Do
not give dextrose-containing solutions subcutaneously as they can cause sloughing of
tissues.
 Oral and nasogastric fluids: Oral rehydration can often be used in mildly hypovolemic
patients if the oral route is not contraindicated. Do not use if:
- The patient is unconscious.
- The patient has gastrointestinal lesions or reduced gut motility e.g. obstruction.
- General anaesthesia and surgery is planned imminently.
WHO/UNICEF formula for oral rehydration fluid:
Dissolve in one litre of drinkable water
Sodium chloride 2.6 g/L
Trisodium citrate, dihydrate 2.9 g/L
Potassium chloride 1.5 g/L
Glucose anhydrous 13.5 g/L
Resulting concentrations
Na 75 mmol/L, CI 65 mmol/L, K 20 mmol/L, Glucose anhydrous 75 mmol/ L, Citrate 10
mmol/L, total osmolarity 245 mmol/L.
Maintenance fluids
Maintenance fluids are used to replace the normal physiological loss that occurs through skin,
lung, faeces and urine. Since a considerable proportion of the loss is water, maintenance
fluids are mainly composed of water in the form of a dextrose solution. Some electrolytes
may also be included in these solutions.
Before giving any intravenous infusion:
 Check that the seal of the infusion fluid bottle or bag is not broken.
 Check the expiry date.
 Check that the solution is clear and free from visible particles.
II. Volume excess
Volume excess is often iatrogenic when the fluid intake has consistently exceeded the
output. Excessive intravenous infusions of saline and blood transfusions are important
60
Emergency Conditions
causes of hypervolemia. Renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, liver disease and
other causes of sodium retention, or excessive sodium administration can all produce
increase in extracellular fluid content and hypervolemia.
Salient features
 Oedema, ascites, pleural effusion, neck veins full, pulmonary congestion,
hyperdynamic circulation with tachycardia, a warm skin, and a bounding pulse.
 Increase in the systolic pressure and pulse pressure.
 Central venous Pressure (CVP) > 12 mmHg, Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure
(PCWP) >20 mmHg in the presence of pulmonary oedema.
Treatment
In moderate volume excess, salt restriction, restriction of fluid intake and the use of
frusemide as a diuretic will solve the problem. Fulminant pulmonary oedema secondary to
over hydration from over transfusion of blood or fluids is more appropriately dealt with by
phlebotomy in stages so that pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is reduced below 15 mm
Hg. Rarely ultrafiltration (dialysis) may be required.

Emergency Conditions
 Remove source of infection-remove indwelling IV catheters and send the tips for
quantitative culture. Replace urinary drainage catheters if obstructed. Consult the
appropriate specialist for drainage of intra-abdominal, sinus, or soft tissue abscesses.
 Monitor blood pressure, pulse, capillary refill, central venous pressure, pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure, and urine output (>30 ml/h in adults, 1 ml/kg/h in children) to
evaluate therapy. If blood loss is suspected, blood replacement may be necessary
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. dopamine 5 to 20 µg/kg/min, titrated to response, if hypotension is refractory to IV
fluid.
 If blood pressure remains <70 mmHg despite preceding measures, Inj. norepinephrine 8-
12 µg/min loading dose and a 2-4 µg/min infusion to maintain mean arterial blood
pressure of at least 60 mmHg should be started.
 Empiric antibiotic therapy. Dosages should be the maximum allowed and given
intravenously. When source is unknown, therapy should be effective against both gram-
positive and gram-negative organisms.
 In adults, a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 1 g IV, cefotaxime 2 g IV, or
ceftazidime 2 g IV) or an antipseudomonal beta lactamase–susceptible penicillin can also
be used. Addition of an aminoglycoside (gentamicin 2 mg/ kg IV, tobramycin 2 mg/kg
IV) to this regimen is recommended.
 In immunocompromised adults, ceftazidime 2 g IV, imipenem 750 mg IV, or meropenem
1 g IV alone is acceptable. If gram-positive infection is suspected (indwelling catheter or
IV drug use), oxacillin 2 g IV or vancomycin 15 mg/ kg IV should be added. If an
anaerobic source is suspected (intraabdominal, genital tract, odontogenic, and necrotizing
soft tissue infection), metronidazole 7.5 mg/kg IV or clindamycin 900 mg IV should
additionally be administered. If Legionella is a potential source, erythromycin 500 mg IV
should be added.
 Acidosis to be treated with oxygen, ventilation, and IV fluid replacement. If acidosis is
severe, administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 meq/kg IV is acceptable as directed by
ABGs.
 DIC should be treated with fresh-frozen plasma 15 to 20 ml/kg initially to keep PT at 1.5
to 2 times normal and treated with platelet infusion to maintain serum concentration of 50
to 100,000.

 Monitor vitals-temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate
 Start intravenous line placement: maintenance IV fluids
 Decontamination: remove of all clothes
 Gastric lavage with activated charcoal and sample collection
 Wash skin with soap and water
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. atropine 2 mg IV bolus, repeat every 5-10 minutes until atropinization (pulse
>80/min, pupillary dilation and drying of secretions) followed by atropine IV infusion at
0.02-0.08 mg/kg/min to maintain atropinasation (glycopyrronium can be used in place
atropine to avoid CNS toxicity).
 Inj. pralidoxime IV 30mg/kg immediately followed by 8 mg/kg/hr continued for at least
24 hours. If an infusion cannot be used, 30 mg/kg every 4 hourly.
 Inj. obidoxime 4 mg/kg bolus initially followed by 0.5 mg/kg/hr infusion Alternatively, 4
mg/kg bolus followed by 2 mg/kg every 4 hourly.
 IV crystalloids: normal saline/ringer’s lactate.

 Flush the skin and oral cavity for at least 15 minutes
 If the chemical is swallowed, immediately give the person water or milk
 If the person breathed in the poison, immediately move him or her to fresh air with patent
airwaywith head low position
 Do not induce emesis
 Put the patient on monitor for vital signs – temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory
rate
 Provide oxygen through nasal cannula or face mask
 Take IV line–start intravenous crystalloids as a supportive therapy
 Patients should be monitored for respiratory complications."
DATURA POISONING,"treatment
 Stomach wash with 1:10,000 potassium permanganate solution or 5% tannic acid
solution.
66
Emergency Conditions
 Decontamination of the patient must be individualized, based on time since exposure,
type of anticholinergic agent involved, route of exposure, probable amount ingested, and
severity of the clinical condition.
 Early gastric emptying (within 1 hour) may be considered for large ingestions, when an
asymptomatic patient presents immediatelyafter ingestion.
 Measure core body temperature with a flexible rectal probe. Aggressive temperature
reduction with ice water or evaporative cooling with mist and fans should be the first
priority in the severely hyperthermic patient. Antipyretic agents and simple cooling
blankets are ineffective.
Pharmacological treatment
 Benzodiazepines like midazolam or lorazepam can be used to control agitation and
sedation.
Inj. midazolam 0.01-0.1 mg/kg IV or Inj. lorazepam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV
 In severe poisoning, Inj. physostigmine 1.2 mg IM or IV, to be repeated after half an
hour, if necessary. Watch for side effects (bradycardia, heart block, excessive secretions).
 Inj. diazepam 10 mg IV diluted slowly may be given for convulsions."
ABDOMINAL INJURY,"Treatment
 Resuscitate the patient, secure airway, maintain breathing, maintain circulation, arrange
for compatibleblood.
 Emergency exploratory laparotomy and further management according to organ injured.
II. Blunt abdominal injury
Blunt abdominal injuries can be due to assault by blunt objects, road traffic accidents and
falls.
Investigations
 Haemoglobin levels, hematocrit, X-ray abdomen standing

 Temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure (TPRBP) charting, abdominal girth
(AG) charting.
 Management of blunt abdominal trauma depends upon vitals of the patients and organs
involved as per seen in USG- Abdomen and Contrast Enhanced Computed Tomography
(CECT) abdomen.
 All patients whose vitals are unstable are to be explored. Emergency exploratory
laparotomy and followed by management according to organ involved.
 All patients whose vitals are stable are reviewed by CECT-abdomen and pelvis and
managed according to organs involved and grade of injury."
FOREIGN BODY IN EAR,"Treatment
 Insects -immobilized using oil and remove with forceps
 Vegetable foreign bodies –remove with foreign body hook (syringing is not advisable).
 Non-organic foreign bodies-remove with syringing and foreign body hook.
 Impacted foreign bodies- remove under general anesthesia using the microscope"
CHEMICAL INJURIES OF EYE,"treatment
A. Copious irrigation
 Place an eyelid speculum and instill topical anesthetic.
 Copious irrigation using saline or ringer lactate solution for at least 30 minutes. Tap water
can be used in the absence of these solutions and may be more efficacious in inhibiting
elevated intracameral pH than normal saline for alkali burns.
 Check pH and ifnot neutral, repeat irrigation.
 NEVER use acidic solutions to neutralize alkalis or vice versa.
B. Double-eversion of the upper eyelid:
 It should be performed so that any retained particulate matter trapped in the fornices is
identified and removed with cotton tip applicator.
 Calcium hydroxide particles may be more easily removed with a cotton-tipped applicator
soaked in disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
C. Debridement: Necrosed area of conjunctiva and cornea should be debrided to promote
healing.
D. Hospitalization: It is required for severe injuries to ensure regular eye drop instillation.
Pharmacological treatment
The main aims of treatment of chemical burns are to reduce inflammation, promote epithelial
regeneration and prevent corneal ulceration.
69
Emergency Conditions
 Steroids
- It reduces inflammation. However, they also impair stromal healing by reducing
collagen synthesis and inhibiting fibroblast migration.
- So topical steroids may be used initially (usually 4–8 times daily, strength depending
on injury severity) but must be tapered off after 7–10 days when sterile corneal
ulceration is most likely to occur.
- Steroids may be replaced by topical NSAIDs, which do not affect keratocyte function.
 Cycloplegia may improve comfort.
 Topical antibiotic drops are used for prophylaxis of bacterial infection
 Ascorbic acid
Improves wound healing and promotes the synthesis of mature collagen by corneal
fibroblasts. Topical sodium ascorbate 10% is given 2-hourly in addition to a systemic
dose of 1–2 g vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) QID (not in patients with renal disease).
 Tetracyclines should be considered if there is significant corneal melting and can be
administered both topically (tetracycline ointment QID) and systemically (doxycycline
100 mg BD tapering to once daily).
 Symblepharon should be prevented by lysis of developing adhesions with a sterile glass
rod or damp cotton bud.
Surgical treatment
 Early surgery may be necessary to promote revascularization of the limbus, restore the
limbal cell population and re-establish the fornices.
 Keratoplasty should be delayed for at least 6 months and preferably longer to allow
maximal resolution of inflammation.
 Keratoprosthesis may be required in very severely damaged eyes because the results of
conventional grafting are poor."
CORNEAL AND CONJUNCTIVAL FOREIGN BODIES IN EYE,"Treatment
Corneal foreign body
 Apply topical anesthetic (e.g., proparacaine 0.5% eye drops).
 Remove the corneal foreign body with a cotton tip applicator, 26 no needle or fine forceps
at a slit lamp.
 Multiple superficial foreign bodies may be more easily removed by irrigation.
 Remove the rust ring as completely as possible on the first attempt. This may require an
ophthalmic drill. It is sometimes safer to leave a deep, central rust ring to allow time for
the rust to migrate to the corneal surface, at which point it can be removed more easily.
 Measure the size of the resultant corneal epithelial defect.
 Treat epithelial defect with antibiotics and carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) eyedrops, if
necessary pad it.
 Alert the patient to return as soon as possible if there is any worsening of symptoms.
Conjunctival foreign body
 Remove foreign body under topical anesthesia.
- Multiple or loose foreign bodies can often be removed with saline irrigation.
- A foreign body can be removed with a cotton-tipped applicator soaked in topical
anesthetic or with fine forceps.
- For deeply embedded foreign bodies, consider pretreatment with a cotton-tipped
applicator soaked in phenylephrine 2.5% to reduce conjunctival bleeding.
- Small, relatively inaccessible, buried subconjunctival foreign bodies may sometimes
be left in the eye without harm unless they are infectious or proinflammatory.
Occasionally, they will surface with time, at which point they may be removed more
easily.
 Sweep the conjunctival fornices with a glass rod or cotton-tipped applicator soaked with a
topical anesthetic to catch any remaining pieces.
 A topical antibiotic (e.g., bacitracin ointment BD; trimethoprim/polymyxin B or
moxifloxacin/ciprofloxacin/ofloxacin drops QID) may be used.
 Artificial tears may be given for irritation."
TRAUMATIC HYPHEMA,"Treatment
 Confine either to bed rest with bathroom privileges or to limited activity. Elevate head of
bed to allow blood to settle.
 Place a shield (metal or clear plastic) over the involved eye at all times. Do not patch
because this prevents recognition of sudden visual loss in the event of a rebleed.
 Atropine 1% solution BD to TDS or scopolamine 0.25% BD to TDS.
 No aspirin-containing products or NSAIDs.
 Mild analgesics only (e.g., acetaminophen). Avoid sedatives.
 Use topical steroids (e.g., prednisolone acetate 1% four to eight times per day) if any
suggestion of iritis (e.g., photophobia, deep ache, ciliary flush), evidence of lens capsule
rupture, any protein (e.g., fibrin), or definitive white blood cells in anterior
chamber. Reduce the frequency of steroids as soon as signs and symptoms resolve to
reduce the likelihood of steroid-induced glaucoma.
 For increased IOP:
- Start with a beta-blocker (e.g., timolol 0.5% or levobunolol 0.5% BD).
73
Emergency Conditions
- If IOP still high, add topical alpha-agonist (e.g., apraclonidine 0.5%, or brimonidine
0.2% TDS) or topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., dorzolamide 2%, or
brinzolamide 1% TDS). Avoid prostaglandin analogs and miotics (may increase
inflammation). In children under 5, topical alpha-agonists are contraindicated.
- If topical therapy fails, add acetazolamide (500 mg orally, BD for adults, 20
mg/kg/day divided three times per day for children) or mannitol [1 to 2 g/kg
intravenously IV over 45 minutes once a day]. If mannitol is necessary to control the
IOP, surgical evacuation may be imminent.
 If hospitalized, use antiemetics for severe nausea or vomiting [e.g., prochlorperazine 10
mg IM TDS or 25 mg BD].
 Indications for surgical evacuation of hyphema:
- Corneal stromal blood staining.
- Significant visual deterioration.
- Hyphema that does not decrease to <50% by 8 days [to prevent peripheral anterior
synechiae (PAS)].
- IOP >60 mm Hg for >48 hours, despite maximal medical therapy (to prevent optic
atrophy).
- IOP >25 mm Hg with total hyphema for >5 days (to prevent corneal stromal blood
staining)."
DOG BITE (RABIES),"Treatment of dog bite and Post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies
Three steps: wound care, passive immunization, and active immunization.
Immediate measures
 Early treatment is essential (less than 3 hours after the bite/injury occurred).
75
Emergency Conditions
 Scrub the wound and its edges with soap and water.
 If the wound is a puncture, swab deeply in the wound and around its edges.
 Follow with application of a virucidal agent: 1% or 2% benzalkonium chloride or
povidone-iodine and rinse.
 Tetanus prophylaxis should be given as indicated by patient’s current immunization
status.
 Do not suture bite wounds immediately. If suturing is required, hold it for 24-48 hours,
applying minimum number of stitches under the cover of antirabies immunoglobulin
locally.
Non immunized persons
 Human rabies immuno globulin (HRIG)- full dose should be infiltrated around wound(s),
and the remaining volume should be administered IM at an anatomic site distant from
vaccine administration. Do not administer vaccine in the same syringe as HRIG may
partially suppress active production of antibody.
 Vaccine Human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) injected IM (deltoid area), one each on
days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The vaccine should be administered in the deltoid rather than the
gluteal region, to avoid accidental injection into fat, which will prevent antibody
formation.
 Rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA) and purified chick embryo culture (PCEC) vaccine-
administered for prophylaxis by the intramuscular route and should have antibody titers
checked at 2 to 4 weeks. It is associated with fewer hypersensitivity reactions in patients
receiving boosters and prophylaxis during pregnancy does not increase in fetal wastage,
congenital defects, should not be withheld when indicated.
 Corticosteroids, antimalarials, and other immunosuppressives can interfere with the
development of active immunity and should be withheld during the course of treatment if
possible.
 Patients with a history of hypersensitivity should nevertheless be cautiously given
immunoprophylaxis in a controlled setting, with antihistamines and epinephrine available
Previously immunized persons
 HRIG should not be administered.
 Vaccine HDCV or PCECV 1.0 ml, IM (deltoid area), on days 0 and 3.

Emergency Conditions"
SNAKE BITE,"treatment can be
administered.
Snakes inIndia
There are about 236 species of snakes in India, most of which are non-poisonous, however,
there are 13 known species that are poisonous and four of these, namely Indian cobra,
Russell's viper, saw- scaled viper and Indian krait are highly venomous and are believed to be
responsible for most of the poisonous bites in India
Salient features
 Viper envenomization (haemovasculotoxic): swelling and local pain, tender
enlargement of local lymph nodes, bleeding from any orifice,epistaxis, vomiting,
hypotension, petechiae, purpura, ecchymoses
 Elapid envenomization (neurotoxic): swelling and local pain, local necrosis and
blistering, descending paralysis, ptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia, paralysis of
jaw and tongue, numbness around the lip and mouth, inadequate ventilation,
paradoxical respiration.
Investigations
 Identification of snake, local swelling within few minutes after bite is an important sig of
viper envenomization.
 Blood stained sputum and non clotting of blood are diagnostic criteria for Russel viper
and Saw scaled viper poisoning.
 Ptosis and glossopharyngeal palsy are diagnostic criteria for Cobra and Indian Krait
poisoning.
 Investigations include
- 20 minute whole blood clotting test
- Hb/ platelet count/ peripheral smear/ PT/ APTT/ FDP/ D-Dimer
- Urine examination for proteinuria/RBC/ hemoglobinuria/ myoglobinuria
- Serum creatinine/ urea/ potassium
- Oxygen saturation/ PR/BP/ RR/ postural blood pressure
- ECG/ X-Ray/ CT/ ultrasound (the use of X-Ray and ultrasound are of unproven
benefit, apart from identification of bleeding in viperine bites).
- ELISA to confirm snake species
Treatment
First aid measures (RIGHT approach)
R: reassure patient and control anxiety
I: immobilize bitten part by splinting the limb
77
Emergency Conditions
G-H: get to hospital-transfer the victim to the nearest treatment facility
T: tell the doctor about any symptoms
Do Not: Apply tourniquet, wash the bite site with soap and any other solution, make cuts or
incision on or near bitten area, apply extreme cold or herbal and folk remedies, suck venom,
give the victim drink, alcohol or drugs
 Ensure airway, breathing and shock management
 Pain can be relieved with non sedating analgesic- oral paracetamol
 Anti-snake venom (ASV) is the mainstay of treatment. In India polyvalent ASV is
available which is effective against all the four common species. ASV should be
administered only when there are definite signs of envenomation i.e. coagulopathy or
neurotoxicity
 Mild and severe envenomation requires 8 to 10 vials. Each vial is 10 ml of reconstituted
ASV. Children should receive the same ASV dosage as adults. ASV should be
administered over 1 hour at constant speed and patient should be closely monitored for 2
hours.
 ASV reactions: Anaphylaxis may be life-threatening. if anaphylaxis is evident, ASV
should be discontinued. Inj. hydrocortisone 100 mg + antihistamine or Inj. adrenaline
subcutaneouslycan be administered for ASV reaction
 Repeat dose of 5-10 vials of ASV i.e. half to one full dose, should continue 6 hourly till
coagulation is restored unless a species is identified against which polyvalent ASV is
ineffective. Only for snakes which inject massive amounts of venom, such as the King
Cobra or Australian elapids, massive doses of 50+ vials are required."
INSECT AND ARACHNID BITES,"treatment.
78
Emergency Conditions
Non pharmacological treatment
 Remove a sting- by scraping it out with fingernails. Be careful during removing the sting,
prevent further spread the venom into the skin and do not puncture venomous sac.
 Minor bites and stings can be treated by washing the affected areawith soap and water,
placing a cold compress (a cloth cooled with cold water) over the affected area to reduce
swelling
 Do not scratch the area becauseit can become infected.
 Wrap an ice pack in a towel and place it on the swelling
Pharmacological treatment
If the bite or sting is painful or swollen
 Tab.paracetamol oribuprofen(children under 16 years old should not be given aspirin)
 Apply a spray or cream that contains local anesthetic,antihistamine ormild
hydrocortisone (1%) on the affected area to prevent itching and swelling
 Tab. cetrizine 10 mg once a day and topical administration of calamine lotion to relieve
pruritus
 Systemic corticosteroids may be appropriate if there are severe side-effects.
 Any person who collapses, or complains of wheezing, feeling of anxiety or faintness,
generalized itching, or tightness in the chest within 1 hour of being stung by an insect
should be treated as having anaphylactic shock. Inj. adrenaline 1 mg (as hydrogen
tartrate) 0.5-1.0 ml IM injection (1:1000 solution), repeat every 15-20 min if required. All
patients should be observed at least for 24 hours for recurrent anaphylaxis (see section on
anaphylactic shock)."

Chapter 5"
MIGRAINE,"treatment
 Avoidance of factors that triggers a migraine attack and suitable life-style modification.
Pharmacological treatment
 The combination of acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine has been use for the treatment of
mild to moderate migraine.
 If NSAIDs/analgesics fail, Tab. sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg PO or Tab. zolmitriptan 2.5
mg PO can be used.
 If early nausea or difficulties taking tablets, zolmitriptan 5 mg nasal spray or sumatriptan 20
mg nasal spray is used.
 Parenteral administration of drugs such as dihydroergotamine and sumatriptan is used for the
rapid relief of a migraine attack.
 Patients with an increasing frequency of migraine attacks, or with attacks that are either
unresponsive or poorly responsive to abortive treatments, are good candidates for preventive
agents. In general, a preventive medication should be considered in the subset of patients
with five or more attacks a month. The drugs that have been used for the prophylactic
treatment of migraine include
- Tab. propranolol 40–120 mg BD or Tab. sodium valproate: 400–600 mg BD
- Tab. topiramate :25–200 mg/d OD
Patient education
 Identify the triggers for the migraine attack (lack of sleep, chocolates, wine etc) and avoid
them.
91
Central Nervous System Diseases"
TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE (TTH),"treatment
 The pain of TTH can generally be managed with simple analgesics such as
acetaminophen, aspirin, or NSAIDs.
 Behavioral approaches including relaxation can also be effective.
 For chronic TTH, Tab. amitriptyline 10–75 mg at night time is the only proven treatment"
CLUSTER HEADACHE (CH),"treatment
 Cluster headache attacks peak rapidly, and thus a treatment with quick onset is
required. Many patients with acute cluster headache respond very well to oxygen
inhalation. This should be given as 100% oxygen at 10–12 L/min for 15–20 min.
 Inj. sumatriptan 6 mg SC is rapid in onset and will usually shorten an attack to 10–15
min. Sumatriptan (20 mg) and zolmitriptan (5 mg) nasal sprays are both effective in
acute cluster headache.
Preventive treatments of cluster headache
Short-Term prevention Long-term prevention
 Episodic Cluster Headache  Episodic Cluster Headache and Prolonged
Chronic Cluster Headache
 Prednisone 1 mg/kg up to 60 mg dail y, Verapamil 160–960 mg/d
tapering over 21 days  Methysergide 3-12mg.d
 Methysergide 3–12 mg/d
 Verapamil 160–960 mg/d
 Greater occipital nerve injection
92
Central Nervous System Diseases"
STROKE,"treatment
 Rapid evaluation is necessary for the use of time sensitive treatments such as
thrombolysis. Close attention is paid to the ABC’s i.e. Airway, Breathing and Circulation
of the patient and treat hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if identified. Once the diagnosis
of stroke is made, a brain imaging study is necessary to determine if the cause of stroke is
ischemia or hemorrhage. CT is useful in identifying early hemorrhage while MRI is
useful in identifying early infarct.
 Blood pressure should be lowered if there is malignant hypertension or concomitant
myocardial ischemia or if blood pressure is >185/110 mm Hg and thrombolytic therapy is
anticipated (See section of hypertension)
 Fever is treated with antipyretics and surface cooling.
 Euglycemia is to be maintained.
 Between 5 and 10% of patients develop enough cerebral edema to cause herniation. Other
anti-edema measures such as head elevation, Tab. furosemide 40 mg OD and
hyperventilation are useful.
 Common complications of bedridden patients—infections (pneumonia, urinary, and skin)
and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolism are to be prevented.
 Intravenous thrombolysis (Table 1):
 Tab. aspirin 75 mg OD
 Inj. heparin 5000 IU SC
 Proper rehabilitation of the stroke patient includes early physical, occupational, and
speech therapy.
Secondary prevention of stroke and TIA
 Control of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation.
 Tab.aspirin 75-325 mg/day is recommended for stroke prevention.
 Tab. warfarin is useful for stroke prevention with a target INR of 2-3 in patients with
chronic nonvalvular AF as well as untreated rheumatic heart disease with AF.
93
Central Nervous System Diseases
Treatment of haemorrhagic stroke
 Inj. mannitol 20% 1g/kg stat followed by 0.5 g/kg IV infusion, Inj. furosemide 40 mg IV
stat, elevation of head end and hyperventilation are useful.
 Antihypertensive agents are instituted if BP is more than 180mmHg systolic or
>130mmHg diastolic. Goal is to keep a mean arterial pressure of less than 130mmHg.
 With thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/µl), transfusion of fresh platelets
is indicated.
 Patients with cerebellar hemorrhages or with depressed mental status and radiographic
evidence of hydrocephalus should undergo urgent neurosurgical evaluation.
 Thrombolytic agents are the mainstay (Table 1).

GUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME (GBS)
GBS manifests as a rapidly evolving areflexic motor paralysis with or without sensory
disturbance.
Diagnostic criteria for GBS
I. Required for Diagnosis
1. Progressive weakness of variable degree from mild paresis to complete paralysis
2. Generalized hypo-or areflexia
II. Supportive of Diagnosis
1. Clinical features
 Symptom progression: Motor weakness rapidly progresses initially but ceases by 4
weeks.
 Demonstration of relative limb symmetry regarding paresis.
 Frequent cranial nerve involvement: Facial (cranial nerve VII) 50% and typically bilateral
but asymmetric; occasional involvement of cranial nerves XII, X, and occasionally III,
IV, and VI as well as XI.
 Autonomic dysfunction can include tachycardia, other arrhythmias, postural hypotension,
hypertension, other vasomotor symptoms.
 A preceding gastrointestinal illness (e.g., diarrhea) or upper respiratory tract infection is
common.
2. Cerebrospinal fluid features supporting diagnosis
 Elevated or serial elevation of CSF protein.
 CSF cell counts are <10 mononuclear cell/mm3.
3. Electrodiagnostic medicine findings supportive of diagnosis
 NCV slowing/conduction block at some time during disease process.
 Distal motor latency increase may reach 3 times normal values.
 F-waves indicate proximal NCV slowing.
III. Findings reducing possibility of diagnosis
1. Asymmetric weakness
2. Failure of bowel/bladder symptoms to resolve
97
Central Nervous System Diseases
3. Severe bowel/bladder dysfunction at initiation of disease
4. Greater than 50 mononuclear cells/mm3 in CSF
5. Well-demarcated sensory level
IV. Exclusion criteria
1. Diagnosis of other causes of acute neuromuscular weakness (e.g., myasthenia gravis,
botulism, poliomyelitis, toxic neuropathy).
2. Abnormal CSF cytology suggesting carcinomatous invasion of the nerve roots
Non pharmacological treatment
 Monitor Airway, Breathing and Circulation. Also includes mechanical ventilator support,
management of autonomic dysfunction and physical therapy.
Pharmacological treatment
 The available treatment modalities are plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG). Both are equally effective. Corticosteroids are not recommended for treatment of
GBS.
 Plasma exchange:
- The advised regimen of plasma exchange removes a total of 200 to 250 ml/kg of
plasma in four to six treatments on alternate days, or over a shorter period if there is
nocoagulopathy. The replacement fluid is saline combined with 5% albumin.
 IVIG:
- 0.4 g/kg per day for 5 consecutive days
- It is both easier to administer and probably safer because there is no need for large
intravenous access.
- Disadvantage is the higher cost of therapy."

 Once culture report comes therapy should be changed accordingly
 Inj. dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg every 6 hourly IV for 2 days. It should be started shortly
before the antibiotic.
 Emergency treatment of increased ICP includes elevation of the patient's head to 30–45°,
intubation and hyperventilation (PaCO 25–30 mm Hg), and Inj. mannitol 20% 1 g/kg stat
2
followed by 0.5g/kg every 4-6 hourly.
 A 7-day course of intravenous antibiotic therapy is adequate for uncomplicated
meningococcal meningitis.
 The index case and all close contacts should receive chemoprophylaxis with a 2-day
regimen of rifampin (600 mg every 12 h for 2 days in adults and 10 mg/kg every 12 h for
2 days in children more than 1 yearof age).
 A 2-week course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy is recommended for pneumococcal
meningitis. Meningitis due to L. monocytogenes is treated with ampicillin for at least 3
weeks. Gentamicin is added in critically ill patients (2 mg/kg loading dose, then 7.5
mg/kg per day given every 8 h and adjusted for serum levels and renal function). A 3-
week course of intravenous antibiotic therapy is recommended for meningitis due to
gram-negative bacilli.
 Tuberculous meningitis is treated as per RNTCP protocol."
VIRAL ENCEPHALITIS,"treatment
 Specific antiviral therapy should be initiated when appropriate.
 Following table shows drugs, dose duration and their common side effects (Table 5).

encephalitis.
 Basic management and supportive therapy should include careful monitoring of ICP, fluid
restriction, avoidance of hypotonic intravenous solutions, and suppression of fever.
 Seizures should be treated with standard anticonvulsant regimens, and prophylactic
therapy should be considered in view of the high frequency of seizures in severe cases of
encephalitis."
NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS,"treatment
 Treatment with anthelminthic drugs can result in complete resolution or significant
regression 80-90% of patients.
 Tab. praziquantel 5-10 mg/kg single dose can be administered to individuals found to
have T solium tapeworms in their stool.
 Tab. albendazole 400 mg PO BDfor 14 days with meals.
 Tab. phenytoin 300 mg PO, pediatric dose: 4-8 mg / kg / day PO divided BD / TDS to
prevent seizures.
 To avoid inflammatory response in the CNS, the patient must be started on
anticonvulsants and high dose glucocorticoids.
Surgical treatment
 Reserve neurosurgical intervention for cases of cysts that have failed to resolve with anti-
helminthic treatment and are causing severe neurologic sequelae.
Patient education
 Prolonged freezing or thorough cooking of pork to kill the parasite.
102
Central Nervous System Diseases
 Personal hygiene or through washing and avoiding unpeeled fruits and vegetables in
endemic areas."
PARAPLEGIA AND QUADRIPLEGIA,"treatment
 The treatment depends on the underlying etiology. E.g. compressive myelopathies usually
require urgent surgical intervention.
 Indications for corticosteroids in paraplegia: neoplastic spinal cord compression,
traumatic spinal cord injuries, acute transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis
optica, sarcoid myelitis, ADEM. The dose is Inj. methylprednisolone 1 g IV for 3-5 days.
Continuation of steroids depends on the underlying cause.
 Fever: The loss of normal thermoregulation and inability to maintain normal body
temperature can produce recurrent fever (quadriplegic fever), although most episodes of
fever are due to infection of the urinary tract, lung, skin, or bone.
 Bladder dysfunction: It generally results from loss of supraspinal innervation of the
detrusor muscle of the bladder wall and the sphincter musculature.
- Detrusor spasticity is treated with anticholinergic drugs like Tab. oxybutynin 2.5–5
mg QID or tricyclic antidepressants that have anticholinergic properties, Tab.
imipramine, 25–200 mg/d.
- Failure of the sphincter muscle to relax during bladder emptying (urinary
dyssynergia) may be managed with the adrenergic blocking agent Tab. terazosin
hydrochloride 1–2 mg TDS or QID, with intermittent catheterization, or, if that is not
feasible, by use of a condom catheter in men or a permanent indwelling catheter.
- Bladder areflexia due to acute spinal shock or conus lesions is best treated by
catheterization.
- Surgical options include the creation of an artificial bladder.
 Bowel regimens and disimpaction are necessary in most patients to ensure at least
biweekly evacuation and avoid colonic distention or obstruction.
 During the first 2 weeks, use of calf-compression devices and anticoagulation with Inj.
heparin 5000 U SC every 12 h or Tab. warfarin (INR, 2–3) are recommended. In cases of
persistent paralysis, anticoagulation should probably be continued for 3 months.
 Prophylaxis against decubitus ulcers: frequent changes in position in a chair or bed, the
use of special mattresses such as water or air beds, and cushioning of areas where
103
Central Nervous System Diseases
pressure sores often develop, such as the sacral prominence and heels. Early treatment of
ulcers with careful cleansing, surgical or enzyme debridement of necrotic tissue, and
appropriate dressing and drainage.
 Spasticity: stretching exercises are recommended to maintain mobility of joints. Tab.
baclofen 15–240 mg/d in divided doses is effective. Tab. diazepam 2-4 mg at bed time
acts by a similar mechanism and is useful for leg spasms that interrupt sleep. Tab.
Tizanidine 2–8 mg TDS is another option."
VERTIGO,"treatment
These medications should be reserved for short-term control of active vertigo. They are less
helpful for chronic dizziness and may hinder central compensation.
 Antihistamines like Tab. meclizine (25–50 mg 3 times daily), Tab. dimenhydrinate (50
mg 1–2 times daily) and Tab. promethazine (25 mg 2–3 times daily, also can be given
rectally and IM)
 Benzodiazepines like Tab. diazepam (2.5 mg 1–3 times daily) and Tab. clonazepam (0.25
mg 1 –3 times daily.
 Anticholinergic agents like scopolamine transdermal patch (for motion sickness only)
 Physical therapylike repositioningmanoeuvres (for BPPV)
 Diuretics and/or low-sodium (1 g/d) diet (for Ménière's disease)
 Antimigrainous drugs (for vestibular migraine)
 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (for psychosomatic vertigo)
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
 A common cause of recurrent vertigo
 Episodes are brief (less than 1 min and typically 15–20 s)
 Always provoked by changes in head position relative to gravity, such as lying down,
rolling over in bed, rising from a supine position, and extending the head to look upward.
 With posterior canal BPPV, the nystagmus beats upward and torsionally
 Horizontal canal BPPV resulting in a horizontal nystagmus
 Superior (also called anterior) canal involvement is rare.
 BPPV is treated with repositioning maneuvers that utilize gravity to remove the otoconia
from the semicircular canal.
 For posterior canal BPPV, the Epley maneuver is the most commonly used procedure.
Vestibular Migraine
 Usually part of migraine aura but can occur independently. The duration of vertigo may
be from minutes to hours. Vestibular migraine typically is treated with medications that
are used for prophylaxis of migraine headaches.
 Antiemetics may be helpful to relieve symptoms at the time of an attack.(See vomiting
section)
Ménière's Disease
 Attack consists of vertigo, hearing loss, & pain, pressure or fullness in affected ear.
 Diuretics and sodium restriction are the initial treatments.
 If attacks persist, injections of gentamicin into the middle ear or full ablative procedures
are required.
 Tab. betahistine 24-48 mg/day relieves pressure from excess fluid. Initial dose 16 mg
TDS initially with maintenance.
105
Central Nervous System Diseases
Psychosomatic Dizziness/vertigo
 Important role in chronic dizziness
 Dizziness may be a somatic manifestation of a psychiatric condition such as major
depression, anxiety, or panic disorder.
 Thus, treatment with antianxiety medications and cognitive/behavioral therapy may be
helpful.

 Tab. frusemide40-160 mg/ day or Tab. amlodipine 5-20 mg/day
 In diabetic nephropathy- Tab. enalapril 1.25-5 mg/day
 If hyperlipidemia –Tab. atorvastatin 10-20 mg/day
 If anemic. Inj. EPO 80-120unit/kg/week SC
Step –4Prevent and treat complications
Malnutrition
 Dietary protein intake of 0.6g/kg body weight/day
 Dietary calorie intake of 30-35 kcal/kg/day
Cardiovascular disease
 Commonest cause of mortality in CKD patients.Risk for IHD increases by 30% for every
increase in serum creatinine by 0.23mg/dl.
 At least yearly screening for cardiovascular disease should be done.
Renal osteodystrophy
 Target calcium – 8.8 to 9.7mg/dl, Phosphorous – 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dl, Calcium –
Phosphorous product < 55 mg2/dl.
 This is achieved by phosphate restricted diet. Tab. calcium carbonate 1 g/day and Tab.
vitamin D -0.25-2 mcg/day

"
HYPOCALCEMIA,"Treatment depends on the cause, the severity, the presence of symptoms, and how
rapidly the hypocalcemia developed.
114
Endocrine Diseases
 Severe hypocalcemia may result in seizures, tetany, refractory hypotension or
arrhythmias that require a more aggressive approach
Pharmacological treatment
 Severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia: 20 ml of 10% Inj. ca.gluconate solution over 10-
15 mins followed by 60-80ml of 10% solution in 1lt of 5% distilled water (0.5-0.25
mg/kg/hr elemental calcium)
 Caution: Should not be mixed with bicarbonate as it may result in precipitation of
calcium carbonate.
 If associated with hypomagnesemia : Inj. magnesium sulphate 1-2 gm IV day 1
followed by oral magnesium oxide 600-1200 mg 3 times a day to replenish stores.
Asymptomatic hypocalcemia / maintenance treatment
 Treat underlying condition if possible. Long term treatment is required in conditions
such as hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism and chronic vitamin D
deficiency states.
 Tab. calcium carbonate (40% elemental ca) 1-2 gm elemental calcium orally 3 times a
day initially and subsequently maintenance dose of 0.4-1.5 g 3 times a day.
 In CRF, calcium alone gives inadequate results. Correct concomitant hyper-
phosphatemia before instituting following therapy: Vit D 50000 IU/day for 1-2 weeks,
then weekly or bimonthly.
 Calcitriol 0.25 mcg orally daily-more expensive and less toxic.
 Advise low Phosphate diet and Phosphate binding agents."

 If non pharmacological measures not sufficient, oral agents may be used alone and in
combination.
 Level of hyperglycemia influence the initial choice of oral hypoglycaemic agents (Table
2).
 Therapy can be started with either sulfonylureas or Metformin. Metformin has the
advantage of promoting mild weight loss in obese patients.
 Treatment may be started with any of the following drugs: Tab. glimipride l-8mg/day Or
Tab. glipizide 2.5 - 40 mg/day. Or Tab. glipizide extended release 5-10 mg/day Or Tab.

foot and skin care; diabetes management before, during, and after exercise; and risk
factor–modifying activities.
 Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is a term used to describe the optimal coordination of
caloric intake with other aspects of diabetes therapy (insulin, exercise, weight loss).
Primary prevention measures of MNT are directed at preventing or delaying the onset of
type 2 DM in high-risk individuals (obese or with prediabetes) by promoting weight
reduction.
 Explain about the warning symptoms and signs of hypoglycaemia and need to take
sweets/candies/drinks in such a situation.
 Regular"
DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS,"treatment
 Admit to hospital; intensive-care setting may be necessary for frequent monitoring or if
pH <7.00 or unconscious. If the patient is vomiting or has altered mental status, a
nasogastric tube should be inserted to prevent aspiration of gastric contents.
 Assess: Serum electrolytes (K+, Na+, Mg2+, Cl–, bicarbonate, phosphate), acid-base
status- pH, HCO3–, PCO2, β -hydroxybutyrate (or S.acetone), renal function (creatinine,
urine output)
 Replace fluids: 2–3 L of 0.9% saline over first 1–3 hr (15–20 ml/kg per hour);
subsequently, 0.45% saline at 250–500 ml/h; change to 5% glucose and 0.45% saline at
150–250 ml/h when plasma glucose reaches 200 mg/dl. Fluid replacement needs to be
closely monitored in elderly and those with cardiac or renal compromise.
 Administer short-acting insulin: IV (0.1units/kg), then 0.1 units/kg per hour by
continuous IV infusion; increase two- to threefold if no response by 2–4 h. If the initial
serum potassium is <3.3 mEq/L, do not administer insulin until the potassium is
corrected. If the initial serum potassium is >5.2 mEq/L, do not supplement K+ until the
potassium is corrected.
 Assess patient: Initiate appropriate workup for precipitating event (cultures, CXR, ECG).
 Replace K+: 10 meq/h when plasma K+< 5.0–5.2 mEq/L (or 20–30 mEq/L of infusion
fluid), ECG normal, urine flow and normal creatinine documented; administer 40–80
mEq/h when plasma K+< 3.5 mEq/L or if bicarbonate is given. The goal is to maintain the
serum potassium at >3.5 mEq/L.
 Bicarbonate replacement: Despite a bicarbonate deficit, bicarbonate replacement is not
usually necessary. However, in the presence of severe acidosis (arterial pH <6.9), it is
advised to administer bicarbonate [50 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate in 200 ml of sterile
water with 10 mEq/L KCl per hour for 2 h until the pH is >7.0].
 Phosphate and Magnesium: If the serum phosphate < 1 mg/dl, then phosphate supplement
should be considered and the serum calcium monitored. Hypomagnesemia may develop
during DKA therapy and may also require supplementation.
122
Endocrine Diseases
 Monitoring: Measure capillary glucose every 1–2 h; measure electrolytes (especially K+,
bicarbonate, phosphate) and anion gap every 4 h for first 24 h. Monitor blood pressure,
pulse, respirations, mental status, fluid intake and output every 1–4 hrs.
 Hyperglycemia usually improves at a rate of 75–100 mg/dl per hour. As ketoacidosis
improves, β -hydroxybutyrate is converted to acetoacetate. Ketone body levels may appear
to increase if measured by laboratory assays that use the nitroprusside reaction, which
only detects acetoacetate and acetone.
 Continue above until patient is stable, glucose goal is 150–250 mg/dl, and acidosis is
resolved. Insulin infusion may be decreased to 0.05–0.1 units/kg per hour.
 Administer long-acting insulin as soon as patient is eating. Allow for overlap in insulin
infusion and SC insulin injection.
Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar Nonketotic Coma
 It is an acute metabolic derangement whose notable features are marked hyperglycemia,
hyperosmolality (>350 mOsmol/L), and prerenal azotemia.
 In HONC, fluid losses and dehydration are usually more pronounced than in DKA due to
the longer duration of the illness.
 The patients are usually older, more likely to have mental status changes, even with
proper treatment, HHS has a substantially higher mortality rate than DKA.
Chronic Complications of DM
Microvascular Treatment
Complications
Diabetic Retinopathy  Proliferative retinopathy is usually treated with panretinal
laser photocoagulation, whereas macular edema is treated
with focal laser photocoagulation.
 Regular fundus examination is required to monitor the
retinopathy.
Diabetic Nephropathy  Administration of ACE inhibitors or ARBs
 Insulin and other OHA requirement may decrease
 give drugs according to renal clearance
Diabetic Neuropathy  Once fully developed is difficult to treat.
 The following drugs can be tried amitriptylin, pregabalin,
gabapentin, carbamazepine, SSRI
 Can lead to autonomic dysfunction and orthostatic
hypotension.
 Foot and joints most be examined for presence of injury.
Diabetic Gastropathy  Smaller, more frequent meals that are easier to digest.
 Dopamine antagonist’s metoclopramide, 5–10 mg, and
123
Endocrine Diseases
domperidone, 10–20 mg, before each meal. Erythromycin
may promote gastric emptying.
 Diabetic diarrhoea treated with loperamide and may respond
to octreotide (50–75 g three times daily, SC).
Diabetic Cystopathy  Timed voiding or self-catheterization, possibly with the
addition of bethanechol.
 Drugs that inhibit type 5 phosphodiesterase are effective for
erectile dysfunction
Macrovascular Complication- Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease are the common
cause ofdeath in diabetic population
Atherosclerotic CVD are the common cause of death in diabetic population.
Risk factor reduction is important. The important lipid target are as follows
 LDL < 2.6 mmol/l (100 mg/dl);
 HDL >1 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) in men and >1.3 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) in women; and
 Triglycerides<1.7 mmol/l (150 mg/dl).
If the patient is known to have CHD, an LDL goal of <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dl).

GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE,"Treatment
131
Gastrointestinal Diseases
 Treatment of GERD involves a stepwise approach. The goals are to control symptoms, to
heal esophagitis, and to prevent recurrent esophagitis or other complications.
 The treatment is based on lifestyle modification and control of gastric acid secretion
through medical therapy with antacids or PPIs or surgical treatment with corrective anti
reflux surgery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Omeprazole 40 mg twice day half an hour before meals. Along with domperidone 30 mg
sustained release
 This therapy causes resolution of GERD symptoms at 4 weeks and healing of esophagitis
at 8 weeks so the treatment should be continued up to 8 weeks.
Surgical Treatment
Indications for surgical treatment include the following:
 Patients with symptoms that are not completely controlled by PPI therapy can be
considered for surgery.
 The presence of Barrett esophagus
 The presence of extraesophageal manifestations of GERD may indicate the need for
surgery; these include the following: (1) respiratory manifestations (e.g., cough,
wheezing, aspiration); (2) ear, nose, and throat manifestations (e.g., hoarseness, sore
throat, otitis media); and (3) dental manifestations (e.g., enamel erosion)
 Young patients
 Poor patient compliance with regard to medications
 Postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
 Patients with cardiac conduction defects
 Cost of medical therapy
 Types of surgery: Open / Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication

CONSTIPATION,"treatment. The important secondary causes
may include neurological, hormonal, colonic, malignancy, depression. Secondary causes
should be looked for in case of recent onset or constipation of severe symptoms.
Salient features
 Constipation is defined as decrease in frequency and liquidity of stool compared to the
normal pattern in a particular individual.
 Important complaints suggesting constipation include straining at defaecation >25% of
time, lumpy/hard stools, sensation of incomplete evacuation, or less than 3 bowel
actions per week.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Reassurance-since many patients with normal stools and in pregnancy, imagine that they
are constipated.
 High fiber diet and increased intake of fluid with decrease in consumption of caffeinated
drinks.
 Retraining of bowels (avoiding suppression of urge to defecate, making a regular habit).
 Bulk forming agents like 'isapghula husk' or 'psyllium seeds' also help to relieve mild
constipation.
 Regular physical exercise such as walk for 1/2 to 1 hour daily and abdominal exercises.

Chapter 9"
TETANUS,"management depends on grade.
Investigations
 Clinical - culture of C. tetani from a wound provides supportive evidence. The few
conditions that mimic generalized tetanus include strychnine poisoning and dystonic
reactions to antidopaminergic drugs. Abdominal muscle rigidity is characteristically
continuous in tetanus but is episodic in the latter two conditions. Cephalic tetanus can be
confused with other causes of trismus, such as oropharyngeal infection.
 Hypocalcemia and meningoencephalitis are included in the differential diagnosis of
neonatal tetanus.
Grading
 Mild or grade 1 –muscle rigidity with few or no spasms.
 Moderate or grade 2-trismus, dysphagia, rigidity and short lasting spasms.
 Severe or grade 3- frequent explosive spasms, autonomic dysfunction particularly
sympathetic over activity may be present.
 Very severe or grade 4- features of grade 3 plus violent autonomic disturbances involving
the CVS –severe hyper or hypotension.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Admit in a quiet room orICU with minimum stimulation.
 Protection of airways (intubation/tracheostomy) with or without mechanical ventilation.
Monitorcardiovascular parameters.
 Cleaning/exploration/debridement of wound
 Maintain hydration and enteral/parentral nutrition with high calorie and high protein diet.
Pharmacological treatment
Grade 1
 Tab. diazepam 5-20 mg 3 times a day; slow IV infusion in moderate to severe tetanus; not
exceed a dose of 80-100mg in 24 hours.
 If spasms not controlled, Inj. phenobarbitone 200mg IM every 8-12 hours or Inj.
chlorpromazine 50 mg IM in adults 4 times a day.
138
Infections
 The ideal sedative and muscle relaxant schedule for each patient should be individualized.
An objective guide to decrease in rigidity is relaxation of abdominal muscles.
Grade 2
 Tracheostomy
Grade 3 and 4
 Ventilatory support
 Inj.pancuronium 2-4mg or gallamine 20-40mg IV.
 If hypotension, give vasopressor support and ifhypertension, give antihypertensive.
 For bradyarrythmias, Inj.atropine 0.6-1.2 mg IV.
In addition,give following to all patients;
 Inj. crystalline 2 mega units 6 hourly IV for 10 days or Inj. metronidazole 500mg 8 hourly
or 1gm 12 hourly. Requirement may be according to theinfected wound.
 Inj. human tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) 3000-5000 units IV or IM or Inj. equine
antiserum 10000 units by slow IV injection after sensitivity test when human TIG is not
available.
 Antiserum should be given before local manipulation of the wound."
LEPTOSPIROSIS,"treatment
 All clinically suspected leptospirosis patients in endemic area during rainy season should
be given presumptive treatment of leptospirosis and malaria. Tab. doxycycline 100 mg
139
Infections
twice daily for 7 days and Tab. chloroquine 600mg (base) stat followed by 600 mg after
24 hours and 300 mg after another 24 hours in malaria endemic areas in adults.
Note: In children less than 6 years 30-50 mg/kg/day of Cap. amoxicillin / Cap. ampicillin
should be given in divided doses 6 hourly for 7 days in place of doxycycline.
Definitive treatment
 Inj. crystalline penicillin 20 lacs IU IV 6 hourly after negative test dose (ANTD) for 7
days. For children the dose of crystalline penicillin should be 2-4 lacs IU/kg/day for 7
days.
 For penicillin sensitive patients, Inj.ceftrioxone 1 gm IV. once daily for 7 days or
Inj.cefotaxime 1 gm. IV. 6 hours daily for 7 days
Symptomatic and supportive treatment
 Care of fluid and electrolyte balance. Hypovolemia and hypotension need prompt
treatment with IV fluids. Patients with oligouria, if prerenal azotemia is suspected,
prompt diuresis should be attempted with fluid therapy.
 Headache and myalgia to betreated with analgesic. Fever with antipyretic.
 Restlessness and anxiety with sedatives and anemia with blood transfusion.
 Peritoneal dialysis has been found to be safe, simple and effective procedure for
management of renal failure due to leptospirosis. If there is contraindication to peritoneal
dialysis, hemodialysis can be done."
CHOLERA,"treatment
 ORS may be made by adding safe water to prepackaged sachets containing salts and
sugar or by adding 0.5 teaspoon of table salt (NaCl; 3.5 g) and 4 tablespoons of table
sugar (glucose; 40 g) to 1 L of safe water.
 Potassium intake in bananas or green coconut water should be encouraged.
Pharmacological treatment
 Euvolemia should first be rapidly restored, and adequate hydration should then be
maintained to replace ongoing fluid losses (Table 1&2).
 WHO recommends ""low-osmolarity"" ORS for treatment of dehydrating diarrhea. If
available, rice-based ORS is considered superior to standard ORS in the treatment of
cholera. ORS can be administered via a nasogastric tube to individuals who cannot ingest
fluid.
 Optimal management for severe dehydration includes the administration of IV fluid and
electrolytes. Ringer's lactate is the best choice among commercial products. It must be
used with additional potassium supplements, preferably given by mouth. The total fluid
deficit in severely dehydrated patients (>10% of body weight) can be replaced safely
within the first 3–6 h of therapy, half within the first hour. Transient muscle cramps and
tetany are common. Thereafter, oral therapy can usually be initiated, with the goal of
maintaining fluid intake equal to fluid output.
 Patients with continued large-volume diarrhea may require prolonged IV treatment to
match gastrointestinal fluid losses. Severe hypokalemia can develop but will respond to
potassium given either IV or orally. In the absence of adequate staff to monitor the
patient's progress, the oral route of rehydration and potassium replacement is safer than
the IV route.

148
Infections
Pharmacological treatment
 Severe disease – hospitalization, intravenous trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole
(TMP/SMX) (15mg/kg/day for 21 days), supplemental oxygen for patients with severe
hypoxemia (PaO2 < 70 mmHg breathing room air at rest). Corticosteroids, prednisolone,
40 mg twice daily for 5 days followed by 40 mg once daily for 5 days, followed by 20 mg
once daily for 11 days.

and an internal hordeolum may discharge and disappear. Persistent lesions may be treated
as follows:
 Dry hot fomentation applied frequently in early stage is useful.
Pharmacological treatment
 Steroid injection into the lesion is preferable if close to the lacrimal punctum because of the
risk of surgical damage.
- Between 0.2 and 2 ml of 5 mg/mLtriamcinolone diacetate aqueous suspension diluted with
lidocaine (or equivalent) to a concentration of 5 mg/mL is injected through the
conjunctiva into the tissue around the lesion with a 30-gauge needle.
- The success rate following one injection is about 80%. In unresponsive cases a second
injection can be given 2 weeks later.
 Cap. doxycycline (100 mg BD for 7 days) may be required as prophylaxis in patients with
recurrent chalazia, particularly if associated with acne rosacea.
 Incision and curettage, in case of large chalazia, if present for more than 3 – 4 months or
if cosmetically unacceptable.
Patient education
 Recurrence may occur; common causes are uncorrected refractive error, blepharitis and
diabetes."
VIRAL CONJUNCTIVITIS,"treatment
Self-limiting condition that typically gets worse for the first 4 to 7 days after onset and may
not resolve for 2 to 3 weeks or longer if there is corneal involvement. It is highly contagious,
usually for 10 to 12 days from onset as long as the eyes are red (when not on steroids).
 Use dark goggles and avoid close contact with other persons for two weeks.
 Restrict work and school for patients with significant exposure to others.
 Frequent handwashing and cool compresses several times per day.
170
Eye Diseases
Pharmacological treatment
 Preservative-free artificial tears (carboxy methyl cellulose 0.5% eye drops) four to eight
times per day for 1 to 3 weeks. Use single-use vials to limit tip contamination and spread
of disease.
 Antihistamine (e.g., epinastine 0.05% BD) if itching is severe. Anti-inflammatory drops
likeketorolac 0.5% may also be used if needed.
 If a membrane / pseudomembrane are present, use a steroid in form of drops with or
without ointment (e.g. loteprednol 0.5% QID, flurometholone 0.1% ointment QID or
dexamethasone 0.3% ointment QID). Steroid treatment is maintained depending upon the
response and then slowly tapered.
 Routine / unsupervised use of topical antibiotics or steroids should be discouraged.
Patient education
 Patients should avoid touching their eyes, shaking hands, sharing handkerchiefs, towels
with family members.
 Patient’s drops or ointment must not be used by other members of the family."
ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS,"treatment
 Cool compresses several times per day and avoid offending agents.
Pharmacological treatment
 Topical anti-inflammatory and anti-histaminic drops, depending on the severity
(olopatadine 0.1% OD/BD, nedocromil 2% TDS, or ketotifen 0.025% BD, ketorolac
0.5% QID).
 In severe cases, mild topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.2% or fluorometholone 0.1%,
QID for 1 to 2 weeks) may have to be added. Steroids are gradually tapered as patient
responds to medications.
 Preservative free artificial tears four to eight times per day.
 Investigate for offending agents and avoidance of the same.
 Oral antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine 25 mg TDS/QID. or cetrizine/
levocetrizine/montelukast/loratadine 10 mg OD) can be helpful in severe cases and in
cases with associated systemic allergy.
171
Eye Diseases"
VERNAL / ATOPIC CONJUNCTIVITIS,"Treatment
 Treat as for allergic conjunctivitis.
 Mast cell stabilizer (e.g. sodium chromoglycate QID) or a dual action mast cell stabilizer
and antihistamine (e.g., olopatadine 0.1% OD/BD) or ketotifen 0.025%, or azelastine
0.05% for 2 to 3 weeks, prophylactically, before the season starts).
 If a shield ulcer is present, add topical steroid (e.g., loteprednol 0.5% or flurometholone
0.1%, prednisolone 1%, etc) four to six times per day. Taper steroids over 4 week as
condition of patient improves. Shield ulcers may need to be scraped to remove superficial
plaque-like material before re-epithelialization will occur.
 Topical antibiotic (e.g., moxifloxacin 0.3% eye drop, tobramycin 1% QID) is given if
associated infection is there or steroids are prescribed
 Cycloplegic agent (e.g., cyclopentolate 1% BD drops or atropine 1% TDS in form of
drops or ointment) if cornea is involved, when there is much pain due to ciliary spasm.
 Consider cyclosporine 0.05% BD if not responding to the preceding treatment. Maximal
effect may not be seen for several weeks.
"
BACTERIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS (NON-GONOCOCCAL),"treatment
 Patients should avoid touching their eyes, shaking hands, sharing handkerchiefs, towels,
etc.
 Restrict work and school for patients with significant exposure to others.
 Frequent hand washing.
Pharmacological treatment
 Use topical antibiotic therapy [moxifloxacin 0.5% drops QID or more frequent in severe
cases] for 5 to 7 days.
 H. influenzae conjunctivitis should be treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (20 to
40 mg/kg/day in three divided doses) because of occasional extra ocular involvement
(e.g., otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis). Antibiotic therapy is adjusted according
to culture and sensitivity results.
 If associated with dacryocystitis, systemic antibiotics are necessary.
Patienteducation
"
GONOCOCCAL CONJUNCTIVITIS,"treatment
173
Eye Diseases
Initiated if the Gram stain shows gram negative intracellular diplococci or there is a high
suspicion clinically of gonococcal conjunctivitis.
 Inj. ceftriaxone 1 g intramuscularly in a single dose.
 If corneal involvement exists, or cannot be excluded because of chemosis and eyelid
swelling, hospitalize the patient and treat with Inj. ceftriaxone 1 g intravenously every 12
to 24 hours.
 In penicillin-allergic patients, consider an oral fluoroquinolone (e.g., Tab. ciprofloxacin
500 mg, for 5 days) or a single oral dose of Tab. azithromycin 1 g.
 Topical ciprofloxacin ointment QID or fluoroquinolone drops every two hours (e.g.,
gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, or ciprofloxacin).
 Saline irrigation QID until the discharge resolves.
 Treat for possible chlamydial co-infection (e.g., Tab. azithromycin 1 g single dose or Tab.
doxycycline 100 mg BD for 7 days).
 Treat sexual partners with oral antibiotics for both gonorrhea and chlamydia as described
previously.
Patient education
 The patient should be followed daily until consistent improvement is noted, and then
every 2 to 3 days until the condition resolves.
 The patient and sexual partners should be evaluated by their medical doctors for other
sexually transmitted diseases."
TRACHOMA,"Treatment
The SAFE strategy for trachoma management supported by the WHO and other agencies
encompasses
S Surgery for trichiasis,
A Antibiotics for active disease,
F Facial hygiene and
E Environmental improvement
 Antibiotics should be administered to those affected and to all family members. Single
antibiotic course is not always effective in eliminating infection in an individual, and
communities may need to receive annual treatment to suppress infection.
- A single dose of azithromycin (20 mg/kg up to 1g) is the treatment of choice.
- Topical 1% tetracycline ointment is less effective than oral treatment; it should be given
for 6 weeks.
 Facial cleanliness is a critical preventative measure.
 Environmental improvement such as access to adequate water and sanitation, as well as
control of flies, is important.
 Surgeryis aimed at relieving entropion and trichiasis and maintaining complete lid closure
with bilamellar tarsal rotation."
BACTERIAL KERATITIS,"treatment
 Maintain proper ocular hygiene by cleaning discharge twice a day.
 Removal of contributory factors like trichiasis, foreign body etc.
 The eye can be covered with a pad, unless the discharge is copious. In such case, shield
the eye with dark goggles.
 Prevention and treatment of complications –secondary glaucoma
Pharmacological treatment
 Control of infection with antibiotics-Start with empirical broad spectrum antibiotics,
which can be changed according to sensitivity report (Table 1).

 Use atropine 1% eye drops or ointment for controlling iridocyclitis, to relieve ciliary
spasm and to prevent synechia formation.
 Other measures like scraping and cauterization. If the ulcer progresses in spite of the
pharmacological treatment, the removal of the necrotic material may be hastened by
scraping or ulcer may be cauterized with 100% carbolic acid, 10% trichloracetic acid 10%
or 5% povidone iodine.
 In case of non resolving ulcers, surgical methods like vasculoplasty, conjuctival hooding
and patch graft, tectonic penetrating keratoplasty and tarsorraphy can be considered.
Patient education
 Use dark goggles and avoid close contact with other persons for two weeks.
 Restrict work and school for patients with significant exposure to others.
 Frequent handwashing"
FUNGAL KERATITIS,"treatment with antibiotic and steroids.
 On examination, definite white ring in the mid periphery of the cornea with healthy cornea
between the ring and ulcer margin is seen (Immune ring-diagnostic of fungal infection)
 Presence of hypopyon is the rule. Higher the hypopyon more ominous the sign and chances
of perforation.
Non -pharmacological treatment
 Use dark goggles and avoid close contact with other persons for two weeks.
 Restrict work and school for patients with significant exposure to others.
 Frequent handwashing
Pharmacological treatment
- Treatment should be instituted promptly with topical antifungal drops, initially every hour
during the day tapered to 4 hrly interval for 3-4 days, then reduced to 4 times a day for at
least 14-21 days or till there is resolution of active stage (Table 2).
- Subconjunctival injections also may be used in cases of severe keratitis, or when poor
compliance exists.
- An oral antifungal (eg, ketoconazole, fluconazole 100mg) should be considered for cases
of deep stromal infection.
178
Eye Diseases
- Fluconazole has been shown to penetrate better into the cornea after systemic
administration compared to other azoles and is associated with fewer adverse effects.
Table 2. Doses of antifungal drugs used in the treatment of fungal infections
Drugs Topical Sub conjunctival/oral Intravitreal
Amphotericin –B 1-10mg/ml drops 0.37mg sc 5-10µg
Natamycin 5% drops 25µg
1% drops
Miconazole
2% oint
Ketokonazole 1% 200-800mg oral/day 0.5mg
Fluconazole 0.2%-2% 100-200mg 6 hourly 0.1mg
Intra-cameral
 Inj. amphotericin-B(5- 7.5% µg in 0.1ml in 5% dextrose)
Intra-corneal
 Inj. amphotericin-B (5µg in 0.1ml) four to five places around the lesion intrastromaly, not
in thin area
 Inj. voriconazole (50 µg in 0.1% in RL solution)
Systemic antifungal
Oral fluconazole and ketoconazole are absorbed systemically with good levels in the anterior
chamber and cornea - therefore they should be considered in the management of deep fungal
keratitis fungal abscess, endothelial plaque.
 Cycloplegics are mandatory and antiglaucoma drugs may be added to the treatment
depending on the intraocular pressure etc.
 Frequent corneal debridement with a spatula is helpful. It debulks fungal organisms and
epithelium, and enhances penetration of the topical antifungal agent
 Surgery is considered in those patients who fail to respond to medical treatment and may
result in corneal perforation. The treatment of choice is therapeutic penetrating
keratoplasty."
HERPES SIMPLEX KERATITIS,"treatment
 Antiviral drugs
- Trifluridine and acyclovir are much more effective in epithelial disease than others.
- Idoxuridine and trifluridine are frequently associated with toxic reactions.
Table 3. Antiviral drugs used in the treatment of viral keratitis
Drug Strength Frequency
Trifluridine 1% solution Every 2 hours while awake
Acyclovir 3% ointment 5 times daily
Idoxuridine 0.1% solution Hourly while awake
Vidarabine 3% ointment 5 times daily
- Oral acyclovir may be useful in treatment of severe herpetic eye disease particularly in
atopic individuals.
- For active treatment 400 mg five times daily in non immunocompromised patients.
- 800 mg five times daily in compromised and atopic patients.
- Prophylactic dosage in recurrent disease is 400 mg twice daily.
- Famciclovir or valacyclovir may also be used.
 Topical corticosteroids accelerate corneal thinning, increasing risk of corneal perforation
 Epithelial debridement is an effective way to treat dendritic keratitis before acyclovir.
Infected epithelium is easy to remove with tightly wound cotton tip applicator.
Adjunctive therapy with topical antiviral accelerates epithelial healing
 Surgical management like penetrating keratoplasty is indicated for visual rehabilitation in
patients with severe corneal scarring. It should not be undertaken until herpetic disease
has been inactive for many months."
PRIMARY OPEN ANGLE GLAUCOMA,"treatment
 Identification of target pressure. From the baseline evaluation data a ‘target pressure’
should be identified for each patient. Progression of disease is uncommon if IOP is
maintained at less than 16 to 18 mm of Hg in patients having mild to moderate damage
and 10 to 12 mmHg in patients with severe damage.
 Single drug therapy. One topical antiglaucoma drug should be chosen after due
consideration to the patient’s personal and medical factors. If the initial drug chosen is
ineffective or intolerable, it should be replaced by the drug of second choice.
181
Eye Diseases
 Combination therapy. If one drug is not sufficient to control IOP then a combination
therapy with two or more drugs should be tried.
 Monitoring of therapy by disc changes, field changes and tonometry is most essential on
regular"
PRIMARY ANGLE-CLOSURE GLAUCOMA,"treatment
Treatment intensity should be individualized dependent on severity. Hospital admission is
usually required in an acute presentation.
 The patient should assume a supine position to encourage the lens to shift posteriorly
under the influence of gravity.
 Inj. mannitol 20% 1–2 g/kg intravenously over half hour or glycerol 50% 1 g/kg orally,
having checked for contraindications.
 Pilocarpine 2–4% one drop to the affected eye, repeated after half an hour, and one drop
of 1% as prophylaxis into the fellow eye. Some practitioners prefer to omit pilocarpine in
an acutely presenting eye with very high IOP until a significant IOP fall has taken place,
as the associated ischaemia will compromise the action of pilocarpine on the pupillary
sphincter and it may also aggravate the pupillary block.
 An additional oral dose of Tab. acetazolamide 500 mg may be given.
 Topical timolol 0.5%, prednisolone 1% or dexamethasone 0.1% to the affected eye,
leaving 5 minutes between each instillation.
 Analgesia and an antiemetic may often be required.
Subsequent medical treatment
183
Eye Diseases
 Pilocarpine 2% QID to the affected eye and 1% QIDto the fellow eye.
 Topical steroid (prednisolone 1% or dexamethasone 0.1% QID) if the eye is acutely
inflamed.
 Any or all of the following should be continued as necessary according to response:
timolol 0.5% BDand oral acetazolamide 250 mg QIDmay be required.
Surgical treatment
 Definitive treatment is laser iridotomy or iridoplasty after corneal oedema clears. Topical
steroids and any necessary hypotensives can be continued for at least a week. Surgical
options in resistant cases include surgical peripheral iridectomy, lens extraction,
goniosynechialysis andtrabeculectomy.
Patient education
 Do not ignore headache or chronic ache in the eyes and report to the ophthalmologist if
coloured halos around light appear.
II. CHRONIC ACUTE ANGLE CLOSURE GLAUCOMA
Salient features
 Many patients with angle-closure maybe asymptomatic, including those with intermittently
or chronically elevated IOP.
 They may have intermittent milder symptoms of blurring (‘smoke-filled room’)
unassociated with pain.
Pharmacological treatment
 Timolol 0.5% or betaxolol0.5% eye drops twice a day usually required lifelong.
Surgical treatment
 Laser or surgical iridotomy is done to eliminate any element of pupillary block in
affected as well as fellow eye.
III. LENS INDUCED GLAUCOMA
Lens induced glaucoma is classified into phacolytic, phacomorphic, phacoanaphylactic
glaucoma, lens particle glaucoma and glaucoma due to dislocated lens. In addition to
medically lowering the IOP, the cataractous lens needs to be removed, under steroid cover to
suppress the inflammatory element."
ANTERIOR UVEITIS,"treatment
 Wear dark glasses
Pharmacological treatment
 Cycloplegic e.g., cyclopentolate 1% eye drops BD for mild to moderate inflammation;
atropine ointment 1% TDS for severe inflammation.
 Topical steroid like prednisolone acetate 1% one drop 1 to 6 hourly, depending on the
severity. Most cases of moderate to severe acute uveitis require 1 to 2 hourly dosing
initially. Consider FML(flurometholone) 1% ophthalmic ointment at night.
 If the anterior uveitis is severe and is not responding to topical steroids, then consider
periocular repository steroids (e.g., triamcinolone 20 to 40 mgsubtenon injection).
 If there is no improvement on maximal topical and repository steroids, or if the uveitis is
bilateral and severe, consider systemic steroids (Tab. prednisolone 1mg/kg), or
immunosuppressive therapy.
 Treat secondary glaucoma with beta blockers, not with pilocarpine or prostaglandin
analogues.
 If an exact etiology for the anterior uveitis is determined (herpes, tuberculosis, ankylosing
spondylitis etc.), then appropriate systemic management is required.
"
ORBITAL CELLULITIS,"treatment
 Warm compresses
Pharmacological treatment
 Intensive antibiotic therapy:
- After obtaining nasal, conjunctival and blood culture samples, intravenous higher broad
spectrum antibiotics should be administered.
- Tab.amoxicillin and clavulanic acid 625mg TDS should be given OR
- Inj. cefotaxime 1-2 gm every 12 hours in adults and 100-150 mg/kg in 2 to 3 divided
doses in children are given. Antibacterials are changed according to the culture sensitivity
reports and continued till resolution of symptoms.
- Ciprofloxacin or vancomycin may be used an alternative.
 Analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs are helpful in controlling pain and fever.
 Surgical intervention is needed when the patient is unresponsive to antibacterials,
decrease in vision and presence of an orbital or subperiosteal abscess.
Patient education
 Any ear, sinus or dental infection especially in children should be treated promptly
 Any patient presenting with unexplained lid edema or cellulitis should be immediately
referred to an ophthalmologist."
ENDOPHTHALMITIS,"treatment
 Post operative endophthalmitis
- Intravitreal injection of antibiotics - Inj. vancomycin hydrochloride 1 mg in 0.1 ml plus
Inj. ceftazidime 2 mg in 0.1 ml or Inj. amikacin sulfate 0.4 mg in 0.1 ml.
- Subconjunctival Inj. vancomycin 25 mg/0.5 ml plus Inj. ceftazidime 100 mg/0.5 ml plus
dexamethasone 0.25 mg/0.5 ml.
- Vancomycin eye drops 50 mg/ml plus amikacin eye drops 15 mg/ml 1 drop every 6
hours.
- Homatropine 2% eye drops 3 times a day or atropine 1% eye ointment 2 times a day.
- Prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops or dexamethasone or betamethasone 0.1% eye drops
every 6 hours.
- Tab. prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in a single morning dose after 24 hours of antibiotic use
and continue for 10-14 days 2 times a day for 5-10 days.
- Parenteral antibiotics are of questionable value and given only as a supportive therapy.
Surgical treatment
Pars plana vitrectomy is indicated if visual acuity is limited to light perception or if there is
poor response to above treatment in 30-36 hours.
 Traumatic endophthalmitis
- Hospitalize the patient and give immunization for tetanus.
- Inj. vancomycin 1 g IV infused over 1 hour, 12 hourly.
- Inj. gentamicin 2 mg/kg every 12 hour or Inj. ceftazidime 2 g IV every 12 hour or inj.
ceftriaxone 2 g IV/day.
- Topical fortified eye drops, subconjunctival injection and intravitreal injection
and cycloplegic drops as in cases of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis.
187
Eye Diseases
 Surgery
- Repair the ruptured eyeball at the earliest.
- Pars plana vitrectomy - indications are similar to that of postoperative bacterial
endophthalmitis.
 Treatment for fungal endophthalmitis
Exogenous fungal infections may occur postoperatively or secondary to trauma.
Endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis should be treated as an emergency treatment.
- Vitrectomy to debulk the vitreous of fungi.
- Intravitreal Inj. amphotericin B 5-10 mcg/0.1 ml or Inj. fluconazole 25 mcg/0.1 ml.
- Inj. amphotericin B 0.5-1.5 mg/kg/day slow infusion over 2-6 hours. (50 mg vial in
powder form and is dissolved in 5% dextrose) for 10-14 days. Or
- Tab. fluconazole 400 mg loading dose followed by 200 mg daily, total dose should not
exceed 600 mg/day. In children 12 mg/kg loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg/day.Or
- Tab. ketoconazole 200 mg orally 2 times a day or daily. In children above 2 years of age,
3.3-6.6 mg/kg/day.
- Homatropine 2% eye drops 4 times a day or atropine 1% eye ointment 2
times a day.
Patient education
 All patients with open globe injury must contact an ophthalmologist after getting initial
treatment.
 Cataract operated cases should never ignore pain, tearing and photophobia and decrease in
vision in the operated eye and must consult the ophthalmologist at the earliest."
OPTIC NEURITIS,"treatment
 Efforts should be made to find out and treat the underlying cause. There is no effective
treatment for idiopathic and hereditary optic neuritis and that associated with
demyelinating disorders.
 Corticosteroid therapy may shorten the period of visual loss, but will not influence the
ultimate level of visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis.
 Oral prednisolone therapy alone is contraindicated in the treatment of acute optic neuritis,
since, it did not improve visual outcome and was associated with a significant increase in
the risk of new attacks of optic neuritis.
 Indications for intravenous methylprednisolone in acute optic neuritis patients with a
normal brain MRI scan are:
- Visual loss in both eyes simultaneously or subsequently within hours or days of each
other.
- When the only good eye is affected.
- When the slow progressive visual loss continues to occur.
 Inj. methylprednisolone 1gm/day (or 15 mg/kg/day) intravenously in 2-4 divided doses
for 3 days followed by Tab. prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day orally for 11 days tapered over the
next week.
Patient education
 Explain the recurrent nature of the disease and that permanent vision loss can occur.
 Avoid factors provoking transient visual obsurations like physical exertion, hot weather,
stress, anger etc."
DIABETIC RETINOPATHY,"treatment
 Early diagnosis, proper diabetic control, regular"
RETINAL DETACHMENT,"treatment
 Treatment of choice is reattachment surgery involving identification of all retinal breaks
areas of vitreous or retinal tractions and induction of aspectic chorioretinal inflammation
around the breaks to seal them.
 Ensuring chorioretinal apposition by approximating choroid/retinal pigment epithelium to
neurosensory retina by external tamponade, internal tamponade and drainage of subretinal
fluid
 Adhesion between retinal pigment epithelium and retina can be achieved by cryotherapy,
diathermy or photocoagulation.
Pharmacological treatment
190
Eye Diseases
No pharmacological treatment which can prevent or cure rhegmatogenous RD. Exudative RD
due to inflammatory conditions like panuveitis can be treated with systemic corticosteroids as
described in treatment of uveitis. The refractory patients can be treated with
immunosuppresants.
Patient education
 Patients with high myopia, family history of RD, post cataract surgery, past episodes of
chorioretinal inflammation should be warned about the premonitory signs of impending
RD (sudden onset of floaters, flashes of light and sudden obscuration of one part of visual
field). In such cases, an opthalmologist should be contacted immediately."
VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY,"treatment
191
Eye Diseases
 Severe xerophthalmia is a medical emergency, so treatment should begin as early as
possible.
 Treatment is aimed at restoring vitamin A level to normal and addressing associated
protein energy malnutrition.
- Oral vitamin A:
0-6 month of age : 50,000 IU (on 0 day, 1st day & after 4 weeks)
6-12 month of age : 1 lakh IU (on 0 day, 1st day & after 4 weeks)
More than 1 year of age : 2 lakh IU (on 0 day, 1st day & after 4 weeks)
 Intramuscular water soluble vitamin A is given to children with persistent vomiting or
severe malabsorption.
 Topical preservative free lubricating eye drops and antibiotic drops (e.g. moxifloxacin
eye drops 1 to 6 hourly) to prevent secondary infection can be given.
Patient education
 Regular consumption of Vitamin A rich foods particularly fresh dark green leafy
vegetables which constitute very rich and cheap sources.
 Pregnant women and lactating mothers should also consume Vitamin A rich diet
regularly.
 Breast feeding including feeding of new born with rich colostrum.
 High dose universal distribution schedule for prevention of Vitamin A deficiency.
- Infants less than 6 months of age –50,000 IU orally
- Infants 6-12 months of age -100,000 IU orally.
- Children more than 12 months -200,000 IU orally every 4-6 months till 5 years of age.
 Mothers -200,000 IU orally within 8 weeks of delivery."
SENILE CATARACT,"treatment
No medical management can halt the progression of cataract. Surgery in the form of small
incision cataract surgery or phacoemulsification is the preferred option.
Patient education
 Do not wait for maturation of cataract for undergoing lens extraction.
 Secondary glaucoma or other complications can develop if total cataract remains
unoperated fora long time.
 Visual rehabilitation in early post operative period is faster in small incision cataract
surgery."
REFRACTIVE ERRORS,"treatment
 No pharmacological treatment is available for ametropia.
 Accurate retinoscopy and corrective spectacles or contact lens.Keratorefractive surgery"
STRABISMUS (SQUINT),"treatment
 Correct the refractive error or associated cataract, corneal opacity etc. Fusion exercises
for intermittent exotropia and other orthoptic exercises. Definitive therapy is surgical
realignment of axis once other associated features have been treated.
Patient education
Functional improvement in strabismus is best between 3-5 years of age. It is a misconception
that squint is spontaneously corrected as the child grows."
COMPUTER VISION SYNDROME,"treatment
194
Eye Diseases
 Counselling regarding the syndrome and work environment modification
Steps for relieving computer eye strain
- Get a computerized eye exam before start using computer. Repeat once a year.
- Use proper lighting. Eliminate exterior light by closing drapes, shades or blinds. Reduce
interior lightingby using lower intensity bulbs and tubes.
- Minimize glare: To install an anti-glare screen on your monitor. Paint bright white walls a
darker color with a matt finish.
- Upgrade your display. Use LCD monitor instead of a CRT monitor.
- Adjust the brightness and contrast of your computer screen.
- Blink more often.
- Exercise your eyes: Follow 20-20-20 rule i.e. after every 20 minutes, look at 20 feet
distance for 20 seconds.
- Take frequent breaks - two 15-minute breaks -four additional five-minute ""minibreaks""
throughout the work day (6-8 hrs).
- Modify your workstation. Proper posture during computer work. Position computer
screen 20 to 24 inches from your eyes. The center of your screen should be about 10 to 15
degrees below your eyes. Top of the screen tilted back slightly (10-20 degree) away from
the operator.
- Consider customized eyeglasses specific for use during work on a computer screen. Anti-
reflective coating in the lenses should be used and avoid contact lens use during computer
work.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tear substitute should be considered if symptoms are aggravated during computer work.
Commercially available tear substitutes include sodium carboxymethylcellulose and
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose.

Surgical treatment
 Uterine curettage: if patient's condition is stable, within 1 hour of antibiotic therapy,
evacuation of the uterus by gentle curettage to remove infected products. If general
condition is low at admission, curettage after 6 -8 hours of antibiotic therapy and treat
hypovolaemia.
234
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Laparotomy in case of injury to the uterus, suspected injury to the gut, presence of
foreign body in the abdomen as evidenced by X ray or felt through the fornix, peritonitis
or colpotomy in cases of pelvic abscess."
ECTOPIC PREGNANCY,"Treatment of ectopic pregnancy should be undertaken at a secondary/tertiary care level set
up. Laparoscopic surgery or laparotomy is done in all cases of ectopic pregnancy except in a
few selected cases that are highly compliant and reliable and fulfill the following criteria:
 Unruptured ectopic pregnancy in haemodynamically stable patient.
 Gestational sac size <3.5 cm in greatest diameter.
 Serum hCG titer < 10,000 mlU/ml.
 Gestation <6 weeks.
 Absence of foetal cardiac activity.
Pharmacological treatment (for unruptured ectopic pregnancy)
 Obtain pretreatment hCG titers, haemogram, liver and renal function tests.
 Inj. methotrexate 50 mg/sq meter body surface area IM given on day 1.
 Repeat hCG titers on day 4 and 7.
 If day 7, hCG titers reflect a drop of at least 15% from maximum levels then weekly hCG
titers till negative.
 If fall <15% or there is rise then repeat Inj. methotrexate.
Patient education
 Resolution of ectopic pregnancy may take up to 6 weeks.
 5-10% cases require surgery despite medical therapy.
 Signs and symptoms of tubal rupture such as vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, weakness,
dizziness or syncope must be reported promptly.
 Patient should refrain from alcohol and folic acid containing vitamins during this period.
 Sexual intercourse should be avoided during therapy."
ANEMIA IN PREGNANCY,"treatment
 Diet rich in iron - jaggery, green leafy vegetable, sprouted pulses, meat, cooking food in
iron utensils.
 Diet rich in protein -pulses, lentils, milk and milk products, nuts, eggs and meat.
Pharmacological treatment
 Oral iron therapy- ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate. Recommended dose is 200 mg
elemental iron daily in divided doses. Not to be taken with meals, milk, coffee or tea.
Continue therapy till blood picture returns to normal and then continue with 100 mg
elemental iron for 3 months to build up the stores. Government of India recommends
minimum of 100 mg of elemental iron and 5 mg folic acid for 100 days starting at 20
weeks (Common side effects are epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and
diarrhoea).
 Deworming to be done after first trimester, if necessary. Tab. mebendazole 100 mg 2
times a dayfor 3 days or Tab. albendazole 400 mg single dose.
Monitoring of response to therapy
Subjective improvement of feeling better, weight gain and improved appetite is seen after 1-2
weeks. Reticulocyte response observed in 5-10 days (increases to 5-6%) and rise in
Hb/haematocrit in 2-3 weeks. The concentration is expected to rise at the rate of 0.1-0.25
g/dl/day or 0.8 -1 g/dl/week. If no improvement in 3 weeks, reevaluate for: incorrect
diagnosis, non compliance, defective absorption, continuing loss, associated deficiencies.
Role of parenteral therapy is limited as rate of rise of haemoglobin with parenteral iron is
similar to oral iron preparation.
Specific indications
Severe intolerance to oral iron, malabsorption, non compliance and moderate to severe
anaemia in advanced pregnancy
Total dose of iron to be given is calculated using following formulae:
2.4 Xweight in kgXdeficit in Hb in gm + 500 mgshould be added for pregnancy.
(Caution:Oral iron is suspended at least 24 hours prior to therapy to avoid reaction).
Intravenous routeis to be given after hospitalization.
237
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Inj. iron dextran is diluted in 5% dextrose. Initial infusion is given slowly at 8 drops per
min. for half an hour to watch for reaction, and then increase gradually to 40 drops/min.
Total iron dose is administered in a single sitting. If >2000 mg then only half dose is
given in one day. Monitor for adverse reactions likerigors, chest pain, and hypotension. If
present stop the infusion.
 Inj. iron dextran or iron sorbitol complex (available as 50 mg ml) IM after an initial test
dose of 0.5 ml intramuscularly, the injections are given daily or on alternate days in doses
of 2 ml IM using Z technique. To prevent staining of skin one can pass small amount of
saline/air down the needle before withdrawing it.
 Inj. iron sucrose intravenously given in each infusion 200mg of elemental iron in100 ml
of 0.9% NaCl infused over 20-30 minutes. No test dose required. Two infusion of each
200 mg of elemental iron is recommended twice in a week.
(Caution: Emergency drugs to be kept ready for resuscitation in case of anaphylactic
reaction).
Indications for blood transfusion
Severe blood loss, severe anemia beyond 36 weeks of pregnancy or anemia refractory to oral
and parental therapy or anemic patient with anoxia or cardiac failure. Management of anemic
patients during labour:
 Propped up position, oxygen therapy.
 Sedation and pain relief.
 Cut short 2nd stage of labour byforceps.
 Active management of 3rd stage of labour with Inj. methylergometrine maleate 0.2 mg IV
at the delivery of anterior shoulder or injection oxytocin 10 U IM.
 Inj. methylergometrine to be avoided in patients of anaemia with cardiac failure.
 Packed cell transfusion if necessary and if Hb<5 g after giving diuretics."
MEGALOBLASTIC ANAEMIA IN PREGNANCY,"treatment
 Tab.folic acid 5 mg daily to be continued for at least 4 weeks in puerperium.
 Inj. cyanocobalamine250 mcg intramuscular every month.
Dimorphic anaemia
 Both iron and folic acid in therapeutic doses.
Patient education
238
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Dietary advice as mentioned earlier.
 Common side effects of therapy should be explained to the patient. Explain to the patient
that stools turn black after oral iron therapy, so no need for concern.
 Iron supplementation should continue for at least 3 months in postpartum period.
 Adequate spacing of at least 3 years between two pregnancies."
PRE-ECLAMPSIA,"Treatment
Hospitalize all cases. Definitive therapy is to terminate pregnancy. The choice between
immediate delivery and expectant management depends on: severity of disease, condition of
mother and foetus and period of gestation (POG).
Mild pre-eclampsia
Expectant management: in cases of mild pre-eclampsia without foetal and maternal
compromise, with gestational age less than 37 weeks.
Non pharmacological treatment
 Complete bed rest preferably in left lateral position and regular diet adequate in proteins
and calories with omission of extra table salt.
Pharmacological treatment
 Antihypertensive treatment is started if there is persistent diastolic blood pressure over
100 mmHg. Aim of treatment is to achieve a systolic BP about 130 mmHg and diastolic
BP around 90 mmHg. Tab. methyldopa 250 mg 8 hourly or 6 hourly (maximum dose 2
g/day)orTab. atenolol 50-100 mg once a day.
 If BP is not controlled in 72 hours with the above, add any of the following:
Cap. nifedipine 10 mg 8 hourly or Tab. nifedipine retard 10 mg 12 hourly (maximum 30
mg 12 hourly) orTab. labetalol 100-200 mg 8 hourly (maximum 600 mg 6 hourly).
 Daily monitoring of weight gain, BP, urine albumin, urine output.
 Weekly lab investigations - haemogram with platelet count, liver and kidney function
tests specially serum uric acid, fundoscopy.
 Foetal monitoring by clinical and USG growth assessment, daily foetal movement count,
non stress test twice weeklyand biophysical score weekly, doppler studies in IUGR.
 In case of mild pregnancy induced hypertension without proteinuria, if after
hospitalization BP is controlled with rest without any antihypertensive drug, patient can
be discharged after initial evaluation if no maternal/foetal compromise is detected. It can
be practiced only in reliable patients who will follow instructions for monitoring as
above, and also will report ominous symptoms immediately (ominous symptoms are
persistent severe headache, visual disturbances such as dimness of vision, double vision
or blindness, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting and oliguria).
Definitive management
Induction of pregnancy by labour induction/caesarean section in the following conditions:
 Gestational age 37 weeks, foetal compromise like severe growth retardation,
oligohydramnios, abnormal non-stress test or biophysical score, maternal compromise
like development of features of severe pre-eclampsia, onset of labour, rupture of
membrane or bleeding.
Severe pre-eclampsia
Treatment is preferably done in a tertiary care center.
Non pharmacological treatment
 Observation in intensive care unit for 24 hours.
240
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Assessment of maternal and foetal conditions. BP monitoring 2-4 hourly, hourly urine
output monitoring, watch for sign and symptoms of impending eclampsia and foetal
distress.
 Lab Investigations: haemogram with platelet count, liver and kidney function tests,
urinary proteins, coagulation profile, fundus examination, obstetric ultrasound with BPS.
 Intravenous fluids Ringer's lactate at rate of 60 ml/h (maximum 125 ml/h).
Pharmacological treatment
The aim of the treatment is gradual lowering of blood pressure so that diastolic BP is
maintained between 90-100 mmHg.
Immediate management
 Tab. nifedipine 10 mg orally can be repeated after 30-60 min. (maximum dose 20 mg 4
hourly).
(Caution: Side effects-Tachycardia, headache, flushing, and aggravation of angina. Rapid
fall in BP can cause foetal distress).
 If BP is not controlled with oral treatment then IV drugs are started with intensive
monitoring.
 Inj. labetalol initial dose is 50 mg slow IV followed by infusion at 60 mg/h, doubling
every 15 min until BP is controlled or maximum dose 220 mg in 24 hours is reached.
Maintenance therapy
 After initial control of acute hypertension, patient is started on maintenance therapy with
antihypertensives as described in management of mild pre-eclampsia.
 Manage with antihypertensives, bed rest and more frequent maternal and foetal
monitoring.
Definitive management is induction of pregnancy
Pregnancy beyond 34 weeks -stabilize maternal condition and induce pregnancy.
Pregnancy less than 24 weeks -stabilize maternal condition and induce pregnancy.
Patient on expectant management develops following features: uncontrolled hypertension
despite maximum dose of 2 antihypertensive drugs, eclampsia, raised liver enzyme >2 time
with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness, pulmonary oedema, platelet < 1 lac/mm1,
creatinine > 1 mg/dl over baseline
After delivery, intensive monitoring should be continued for 72 hours with prophylactic
anticonvulsant continued till 24 hours postpartum. Dose of antihypertensives should be
gradually reduced.
Prophylactic anticonvulsants
 Required in women with severe pre-eclampsia especially in cases with signs and
symptoms of impending eclampsia. Dose is same as for eclampsia.
241
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Loading dose is magnesium sulfate - 4g IV as 20% solution over 20 minutes and 10 g IM
as (50% solution, 10 ml (5 g) in each buttock (total of 14 g) followed by second dose in
alternate buttocks every 4 hours.
 Before each dose, monitor for presence of patellar reflex, respiratory rate >16/min and
urine output > 25 ml/h. It should be discontinued after 24 hours after BP is lowered.
 After initial evaluation and stabilization of the patient further management is decided
depending on foetal maturity and maternal response.
 Expectant management- Considered if pregnancy is between 24-34 weeks and
hypertension controlled with maximum of two drugs, urine output is normal, lab
investigations are normal and no foetal compromise. Patient should be hospitalized till
delivery."
ECLAMPSIA,"Treatment (to be managed at a tertiary care level)
Principles of management are control and prevention of recurrence of convulsion and control
of hypertension. Treat any complication that arise and deliver safely as soon as possible.
Continue anticonvulsant therapy 24 h after delivery or last fit whichever is latest.
Non pharmacological treatment
 Place the patient in left lateral position in a separate, quiet room.
 Secure and maintain airway.
 Use mouth gag or airway to prevent tongue biting/tongue falling back.
 Intubate if patient is deeply unconscious, poor arterial blood gases, extensive laryngeal
oedema, and extreme restlessness.
 Suction to remove oropharyngeal secretions. Oxygen by face mask.
 Set up IV access.
 Monitor heart rate and respiration, BP, urine output.
 Laboratory investigations: haemogram with platelet count, liver and kidney function tests,
urinary proteins, coagulation profile, serum electrolytes, fundus examination.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. magnesium sulphate loading dose of 14 g of which, 4 g as 20% solution given slowly
IV over 5 -10 minutes and 5 g as 50% solution given deep IM in each buttock (total 10 g
242
Obstetrics andGynecology
IM) If fits are not controlled in 15 min, give 2 g magnesium sulfate as 20% solution slow
IV.
 Maintenance dose 5 g magnesium sulfate as 50% solution deep IM every 4 hours in
alternate buttock Or Continuous IV regimen 4 g loading dose over 20 minutes followed
by 1 g/h slow continuous IV infusion. (Caution: Side effects are respiratory depression
and neuromuscular depression in mothers. Neonatal respiratory and neuromuscular
depression). If respiratory depression occurs, give calcium gluconate 1 g IV as 10% sol. If
respiratory arrest occurs, immediate endotracheal intubation and ventilation is to be done.
Monitor: Check for respiratory rate to be more than 16/min, patellar reflex to be present
and urine output >25 ml/h before giving magnesium sulfate. Or
 Inj. phenytoin loading dose of 15-25 mg/kg slow IV not exceeding 25 mg/ min diluted in
normal saline for first 750 mg and then 12.5 mg/min followed by 100 mg IV 8 hourly.
o ECG tracing to be taken every minute for 10 min during infusion of first 750 mg.
o Fluid management should be closely monitored to prevent complications such as
pulmonary oedema, left ventricular failure and adult respiratory distress
syndrome.
 Antihypertensives: as described in pre-eclampsia. Aim is to gradually lower the BP to
140-150/90-100 mm Hg.
Definitive management is termination of pregnancy irrespective of the foetal maturity.
Termination is by labour induction and vaginal delivery or caesarean section.
Indications of caesarean section are: all deeply unconscious patients unless delivery is
imminent, uncooperative patient due to restlessness, if vaginal delivery is unlikely to occur
within 6-8 hours from the onset of 1st eclamptic seizure or eclamptic seizures are not
controlled in 6-8 hours, and other obstetric indications.
Care after delivery
 Patients of eclampsia and severe pre-eclampsia need intensive monitoring for at least
initial 72 hours.
 Continue anticonvulsant till 24 hours after delivery or fit, whichever occurs later.
Graduallydecrease the dose of antihypertensives.
 Patient is discharged after 10-14 days of delivery or earlier if BP controlled without
antihypertensives.
"
PREGNANCY WITH DIABETES,"treatment
Dietary advice
 Total daily calorie intake should be 30 Cal/kg.
 Complex carbohydrates should provide about 50% of the total calories, which should be
well distributed throughout the day.
 Meals should be split in 3 major meals and 3-4 snacks.
 High fiber diet is beneficial with 30-50 g fibers daily. Total diet should be distributed in 3
major meals and 3 mid meal snacks.
General measures
 Ultrasound assessment of foetal gestational age is to be done as early as possible.
 Foetal congenital anomalies should be ruled out by level II USG scan at 16 -18 weeks,
foetal echo at 22 weeks.
 Serial USG for foetal growth monitoring and biophysical scoring for assessment of foetal
well being after 32 weeks of gestation.
Pharmacological treatment
(I) Antenatal management.
Initial evaluation should include blood sugar and fundoscopy.
(a) Pre-existing diabetes
 Oral hypoglycaemic agents are contraindicated during pregnancy. If patient is on oral
hypoglycaemics, switch over to insulin therapy as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed.
 Inj. Insulin: 0.6-0.8 U/kg in 1st trimester, 0.7 - 0.9 U/kg in 2nd trimester and 0.8 - 1.2
U/kg in 3rd trimester.
 Usually a combination of intermediate acting and regular insulin in proportion of 2:1 is
given. 2/3 of the total requirement is given in the morning before breakfast and 1/3 is
given at night with regular insulin before dinner and intermediate at bedtime.
 Dose adjustment is done to maintain blood sugar level between fasting <95 mg% and
postprandial between 70 and 120 mg%.
 Sampling of blood should be done initially fasting, pre and post breakfast, pre and post
lunch, pre and post dinner and 2 AM regularly till controlled and then daily monitoring by
fasting and postmeal sugars.
244
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Hospitalization is required in cases of excessive vomiting, infections, maternal
complications like hypertension, retinopathy, nephropathy, foetal compromise like
macrosomia or intra uterine growth retardation (IUGR) or poor diabetic control.
(b) Gestational diabetes.
General management is same as outlined above.
 Patient is reassessed after 1 week. If control not achieved, insulin therapy is started.
Confirmation of blood sugar and regular insulin if required may be given before
breakfast, before lunch and before dinner or combination of regular and long acting can
be given before breakfast and dinner. Hypoglycaemia should be avoided.
 If fasting plasma sugar is > 105 mg% insulin is usually required for control. Regular
insulin is adjusted to normalize post breakfast glucose and intermediate for post lunch
glucose control. If evening or fasting glucose is elevated, 2nd daily injection is added. If
both are elevated, mixture of intermediate and regular insulin before dinner is added. If
only fasting is elevated, add intermediate acting insulin at bedtime. Or
 Inj. regular insulin 3 times a day before each main meal which can be combined with one
dose of intermediate acting insulin at bed time in case there is fasting hyperglycaemia.
 Apart from routine antenatal monitoring, blood sugar monitoring is required throughout
pregnancy. Therapeutic goal is to achieve plasma blood sugar levels fasting <95 mg% and
2 hour postprandial <120 mg%. When levels are high daily monitoring with insulin dose
adjustment is required. Once control is achieved, patient can be managed at home with
weekly blood sugar profile.
 Glycosylated Hb (HbA ) to be done in 1st trimester. Value of 9% or above
lc
indicates poor glycemic control, carries higher risk of congenital malformation; MTP may
be offered after proper evaluation.
(II) Management during labour
 In uncomplicated case with good glycaemic control pregnancy can be continued till
expected date of delivery.
 In presence of complications or foetal compromise pregnancy is terminated at 38 weeks
or earlier if required.
 If estimated foetal weight is >4 kg, caesarean section is performed.
 Labour is managed with intensive monitoring. Blood sugars are monitored 3-4 hourly aim
is to keep blood sugars between 100-120 mg%, using the sliding scale method using
regular insulin. In the postpartum period, the requirement of insulin is decreased.
Patient education
 In known diabetics, good blood sugar control should be achieved in preconception period
to avoid high risk of congenital anomalies.
 Strict adherence to the dietary advice and insulin therapy is essential throughout
pregnancy. As insulin requirements change throughout pregnancy therefore, frequent
blood sugar monitoring is required throughout pregnancy.
245
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Patient on insulin therapy should be told about symptoms of hypoglycaemia like
palpitations, sweating, dizziness, and its management.
 In cases of gestational diabetes, there is risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies and
later on risk of frank diabetes is there.
Contraceptive advice
Combined oral contraceptive pills and intrauterine devices are preferably avoided. Barrier
methods, progestogen only pills/ implants/injectables or sterilization can be offered."
PREGNANCY WITH HEART DISEASE,"treatment
 NYHA class III and IV patients are to be hospitalized throughout the pregnancy while
class I and II can be managed as outdoor patients with more frequent antenatal visits and
admission at 38 weeks.
 Rest for 10 hours each night and 1 to 2 hour after each meal. Light housework and
walking without climbing stairs is permitted. No heavy work is allowed.
 Avoid high salt intake.
 Screen and treat at the earliest for excessive weight gain, abnormal fluid retention,
anaemia, pregnancy induced hypertension, infections.
Pharmacological (in consultation with the cardiologist)
In caseof rheumatic heart disease,
 Inj. benzathine penicillin 1.2 mega units IM 3 weekly.
 Treat any infections with appropriate antibiotics.
 In patients with mechanical prosthetic valves, give Inj. heparin throughout pregnancy to
maintain PTT at 1.5 to 2.5 times the normal control.
(Caution: Oral anticoagulants are not safe during pregnancy because of risk of congenital
anomalies in the foetus. But if required, can be given after first trimester and continued till 4
weeks before delivery. However, oral anticoagulants are safe during lactation).
246
Obstetrics andGynecology
Labour management
Caesarean is performed for only obstetrical indications.
 Pain relief is important during labour. Best option is to give continuous epidural
analgesia. It is contraindicated in women with intra cardiac shunts, aortic stenosis,
pulmonary hypertension, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Inj. morphine can also be
given for pain relief.
 Fluids should be restricted to 75 ml/min. Bolus oxytocin and methyl ergometrine should
be avoided.
 Antimicrobial prophylaxis for infective endocarditis required in all patients with cardiac
lesions undergoing any operative procedure or in labour.
 Inj. ampicillin 2 g and Inj. gentamicin 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 120 mg) IV or IM 30 min
before procedure followed by Cap. ampicillin 1 g IM or IV; or Cap. amoxycillin I g orally
6 hours after initial dose.
 If patient is allergic to penicillin Inj. vancomycin 1 g IV (over 1-2 hours) plus Inj.
gentamicin 1.5 g/kg (maximum 120 mg). Infusion to be completed within 30 min before
procedure.
Patient education
 Depending on the type and severity of cardiac lesion maternal risk of pregnancy should
be discussed with the patient ideally before pregnancy
 Option of corrective surgery preferably before pregnancy.
 2-5% risk of congenital heart disease in foetus if mother has congenital heart disease.
 Contraceptive advice: sterilization after 2 weeks, progestogen only method or barrier
method. Counsel husband for male sterilization preferably by nonscalpel vasectomy.
 In severe cases option of medical termination of pregnancy if pregnancy <12 weeks."
ANTEPARTUM HEMORRHAGE (APH),"Treatment
All patients of APH should be hospitalized in a well equipped center with facilities for blood
transfusion, emergency caesarean section and neonatal care unit.
(I) Massive hemorrhage
Following resuscitative measures are started immediately in massive hemorrhage.
Simultaneously prepare the patient for induction of labour by vaginal, caesarean section
depending on thecause of bleeding.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Establish intravenous line (one or two 14/16 gauge cannula
 Draw 20 ml blood for cross-match, haemogram, coagulation profile.
 Start fluid therapy rapidly as described below.
 Head down tilt, keep the patient warm.
 Oxygen by mask at 8 liters/minute.
 Empty bladder (Foley's catheter for urine output).
Pharmacological treatment
 IV fluids and blood replacement therapy.
 Definitive treatment is induction of labour by caesarean section in cases of placenta
praevia and by vaginal/caesarian section in cases of abruptio placentae.
(II) Mild APH
Expectant management
 In a case of placenta praevia without maternal and foetal compromise, expectant
management is planned if pregnancy is less than 37 weeks and patient is not having active
bleeding and labour pains.
248
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Hospitalize and bed rest with foetal and maternal monitoring.
 Inj. dexamethasone 12 mg IM 12 hourly for 2 doses should be given for foetal lung
maturity if POG < 35 weeks.
 Definitive treatment is induction of labour in case of following: occurrence of life-
threatening bleeding, pregnancy > 37 weeks, patient is in labour, in all cases of abruptio
placentae, baby is dead, congenitally malformed baby and bleeding recurring or
premature rupture of membranes on expectant management leading to maternal or foetal
compromise.
 Indications for caesarean section are: major degree placenta praevia, non vertex
presentation, case of abruptio placentae with live foetus if cervix is unfavourable (labour
is likely to be longer than 6 hours), Failure to progress after amniotomy and oxytocin
infusion and other obstetrical indications for caesarean section.
 Indications for vaginal delivery in APH are: Minor degree placenta praevia with vertex
presentation and slight bleeding with favourable cervix and abruptio placentae with mild
bleeding and no increased uterine tone, foetus is dead or has major congenital
malformation incompatible with life.
 For induction artificial rupture of membranes followed by oxytocin infusion is done.
Oxytocin infusion is continued in the postpartum period to prevent postpartum
haemorrhage. In abruptio placentae monitoring is done to detect maternal complication
early (pulse, BP,uterine height girth chart, vaginal bleeding, urinary output, BT,CT,clot
retraction time).
Patient education
 APHirrespective of type and cause results in increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.
 Incidence of placental abruption and placenta praevia are both increased with increasing
age and parity.
 Hypertension, cigarette smoking, cocaine abuse etc. predispose to placental abruption."
PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES,"management
 Confirm accuracy of calculated gestational age, if possible.
 Per speculum examination to assess vaginal discharge (amount, colour, odour) and
exclude urinary incontinence.
Diagnosis of vaginaldischarge(Table 2)
a) Light bleeding: takes longer than five minutes for a clean pad or cloth to be soaked.
b) Determine cause and treat accordingly.
Confirm diagnosis
 The typical odour of amniotic fluid confirms the diagnosis.
249
Obstetrics andGynecology
 If membrane rupture is not recent or when leakage is gradual, confirming the diagnosis
may be difficult:
 Place a vaginal pad over the vulva and examine it (visually and by odour) one hour later.
 On per speculum examination: Fluid may be seen coming from the cervix or forming a
pool in theposterior fornix; and on coughing; there may a gush of fluid.
 If available, perform tests:
-Thenitrazine test depends upon the fact that vaginal secretions and urine are acidic while
amniotic fluid is alkaline.
- For the ferning test, spread some fluid on a slide and let it dry. Examine it with a
microscope. Amniotic fluid crystallizes and may leave a fern-leaf pattern. False
negatives are frequent.
Table 2. Clinical presentation of patients with vaginal discharge in pregnancy

Treatment
 If there is vaginal bleeding with intermittent or constant abdominal pain, suspect abruptio
placentae.
 If there are signs of infection (fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge), give antibiotics as
for amnionitis
 If there are no signs of infection and the pregnancy is less than 37 weeks (when fetal
lungs are more likely to be immature): give antibiotics to reduce maternal and neonatal
infective morbidity and to delay delivery
 Pre-labourrupture of membranes
250
Obstetrics andGynecology
- Tab. erythromycin 250 mg by mouth three times per day for seven days or amoxicillin
500 mg by mouth three times per day for seven days;
- Consider transfer to the most appropriate service for care of the newborn, if possible
- Give corticosteroids to the mother to improve fetal lung maturity: betamethasone 12
mg IM, two doses 24 hours apart or Inj. dexamethasone 6 mg IM, four doses 12
hours apart.
Note: Corticosteroids should not be used in the presence of frank infection.
 Induce labour using oxytocin at 37 weeks and give prophylactic antibiotics to help reduce
Group B streptococcus infection in the neonate, even if the woman received antibiotics
previously: penicillin G 2 million units IV every six hours until delivery; or Inj.
ampicillin 2 g IV every six hours until delivery.
 If there are palpable contractions and blood-stained mucus discharge, suspect preterm
labour.
 If there areno signs of infection and thepregnancy is 37 weeks or more:
- If the membranes have been ruptured for more than 18 hours, give prophylactic
antiboitics to help reduce Group B streptococcus infection in the neonate.
- Assess the cervix
- If thecervix is favourable (soft, thin, partly dilated), induce labour using oxytocin.
- If the cervix is unfavourable (firm, thick, closed), ripen the cervix using
prostaglandins and infuse oxytocin or deliver by caesarean section.
Amnionitis
 Give a combination of antibiotics until delivery
- Inj. ampicillin 2 g IV every six hours; plus gentamicin 5 mg/kg body weight IV every 24
hours
- If thewoman delivers vaginally, discontinue antibiotics postpartum
- Ifthewoman has a caesarean section, continue antibiotics and give Inj. metronidazole
500 mg IV every eight hours until the woman is fever-free for 48 hours.
 Assess the cervix
- If thecervix is favorable (soft, thin, partly dilated), induce labour using oxytocin
- If thecervix is unfavourable (firm, thick, closed), ripen the cervix using prostaglandins
and infuse oxytocin or deliver by caesarean section.
 If metritis is suspected (fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge), give antibiotics.
 If newborn sepsis is suspected, arrange for a blood culture and antibiotics."
PRETERM LABOR,"treatment
 Hospitalization with complete bed rest, preferably in a centre with neonatal intensive care
unit.
 Laboratory investigations: haemogram, urine culture, endocervical swab for culture and
sensitivity.
Pharmacological treatment
 Inj. pentazocine 15mg + Inj. promethazine 25 mg IM stat and can be repeated 8 hourly.
 Immediate tocolysis in pregnancies <35 week
 If membranes are intact and labour is not advanced (cervical dilatation <4 cm), there is no
indication for immediate delivery and no contraindication for tocolysis.
 Inj. isoxsuprine HCl 10 mg IM every 6 hours in case of mild contraction; Intravenous
infusion if strong contractions are established 0.2-0.4 mcg/min in 5% dextrose. Maximum
dose is 0.8 mcg/min to be continued at least 2 hours after the contractions cease.
Followed by IM therapy for 24 hours.
(Caution: Side effects tachycardia and hypotension, hypokalaemia, neonatal tachycardia,
hypotension and rarely pulmonary oedema and acute respiratorydistress syndrome). Or
 Inj. ritodrine infusion 3 ampoules (150 mg) in 500 ml of 5% dextrose or ringer lactate at
50- 100 mcg/min (5-6 drops/min), increase by 50 mcg every 10 min till contractions
cease or side effects appear (maximum dose 350 mcg/min), continue for 12 hour after
contractions stop. This is followed by oral treatment - 10 mg every 2 hours for 24 hours
then 10-20 mg every 4-6 hours. (Contraindications: Poorly controlled diabetes or thyroid
disease, sickle cell disease). Or
 Cap. Nifedipine 30 mg loading dose followed by 10-20 mg every 4-6 hours.

weakness, dryness of mouth, nausea and foetal distress, transient non-reactive non-stress
test (NST).
 Monitor pulse, BP, and cessation of the uterine contractions. If pulse rate >120/min and
BP < 90/50 mmHg stop tocolysis. Monitoring in magnesium sulfate therapy is as outlined
in eclampsia. Monitor for onset of chorioamnionitis (fever, tachycardia with uterine
tenderness).
Maintenance therapy
 Tab. isoxsuprine orally 10 mg 6 hourly or 20 mg 12 hourly (maximum daily-dose is 40 to
80 mg/day) to be continued till 34 weeks of pregnancy (long term therapy is
controversial).
 In pregnancies at 28 -34 weeks of maturity, steroids are given for foetal lung maturity.
 Inj. betamethasone 12 mg IM 2 doses 24 hours apart or Inj. dexamethasone 6 mg IM four
doses 12 hours apart or 12 mg IM two doses 12 hours apart.
(Caution: Contraindicated if clinical or laboratory evidence of chorioamnionitis is
present).
 Cap. ampicillin 500 mg or erythromycin 500 mg 4 times a day for 5-7 days, only if
PROM is present.
 Patient may be discharged after 1 week of tocolysis followed by regular antenatal
surveillance.
Delivery
In cases of ineffective tocolysis or with contraindications for tocolysis, labour is allowed to
progress and mode of delivery is decided as per obstetric indications. Careful foetal
monitoring required throughout labour. If any sign of hypoxia, caesarean section is better but
foetus should have a fairly good chance of survival depending on neonatal care facility.
Patient education
 Restricted physical activity after discharge.
 Sexual abstinence till at least 34 weeks of gestation.
 Explain the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancy. Therefore need for early booking
and prophylactic measures in next pregnancy."

General examination
 Record height and weight.
 Pulserate (PR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature.
 Look for pallor, pedal oedema, jaundice and cyanosis.
 Auscultate cardiovascular and respiratory system.
Per abdomen examination
 Height of the uterus/POG.
 Presentation, attitude, palpable foetal head (rule of fifths).
 Foetal heart rate.
254
Obstetrics andGynecology
 Uterine contractions -+/-, intensity, duration and frequency per 10 minutes.
 Amount of liquor.
 Size of the baby/estimated baby weight.
 Look for overriding of foetal head over symphysis pubis.
 Features of obstructed labour and contour of the uterus.
Per vaginum examination
 Observe aseptic precautions -hand washing and sterile gloves. Note:
 Cervical dilatation and effacement.
 Presentation and station of presenting part.
 Position and degree of flexion (sutures and fontanelle).
 Status of membranes and if leaking present then colour of liquor.
 Cord prolapse or presentation to be ruled out.
 Pelvic adequacy and rule out cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD).
 Vaginal examination should be carried out atleast once every 4 hours during first
stage of labour and after rupture of membranes.
Investigations
 Minimum investigations required during labour are:
 Hb, urine albumin and sugar, blood grouping.
 Urine acetone in prolonged/obstructed labour."
THIRD STAGE OF LABOUR,"management of third stage should be done unless contraindicated.
 Examine the woman for any tears and repair if any. Stitch the episiotomy. Observe the
woman closely for one hour after delivery, record her PR and BP.
 Evaluate the uterus frequently, and inspect the perineum to detect excessive bleeding and
haematoma formation.
Transfer from labour room
 Observe for 2 hours
 Check the following before transfer: pulse rate, BP, uterus, bleeding pre vaginum, inspect
external genitalia for condition of stitches and any haematoma, passed urine.
Episiotomy (Incision of the perineum)
 Not to be performed routinely.
 Applied selectively for: breech, forceps or vacuum delivery, occiput posterior positions,
rigid perineum, scarred perineum, and shoulder dystocia.
 Clean the area with antiseptic solution.
 Infiltrate beneath the vaginal mucosa, beneath the skin and deeply into the perineal
muscle using 10 ml of 0.5 -1% lignocaine.
 Check at the incision site for effect of local anaesthetics by pinching with a forceps before
giving incision.
 Perform episiotomy at crowning. Place two fingers between the baby's head and the
perineum and cut 3-4 cm of perineum in mediolateral direction.
257
Obstetrics andGynecology
 After delivery of the baby and placenta, carefully examine for extensions of tears.
 Repair the episiotomy with vicryl rapide 2-0 suture (chromic catgut if vicryl is not
available). Close the vaginal mucosa with continuous suture starting 1 cm above the apex.
Perineal muscles are approximated using interrupted sutures. Skin is closed with
subcuticular (or interrupted) sutures.
Care of episiotomy
Perineal hygiene: Clean the area with antiseptic solution after urination and defaecation.
Analgesics are prescribed for allaying pain.
Respond to following problems during labour and delivery
Assess facilities and expertise available and appropriate timely"
FETAL DISTRESS IN LABOR,"management
 If a maternal cause is identified (e.g. maternal fever, drugs), initiate appropriate
management.
 If a maternal cause is not identified and the fetal heart rate remains abnormal throughout
at least three contractions, perform a vaginal examination to check for explanatory signs
of distress:
 If there is bleedingwith intermittent or constant pain, suspect abruptio placentae.
 If there are signs of infection (fever, foul-smelling vaginal discharge) give antibiotics as
for amnionitis.
 A normal fetal heart rate may slow during a contraction but usually recovers to normal as
soon as the uterus relaxes.
 A very slow fetal heart rate in the absence of contractions or persisting after contractions
is suggestive of fetal distress.
 A rapid fetal heart rate may be a response to maternal fever, drugs causing rapid maternal
heart rate (e.g. terbutaline or ritodrine), hypertension or amnionitis. In the absence of a
rapid maternal heart rate, a rapid fetal heart rate should be considered a sign of fetal
distress.
 If thecord is below the presenting part or in the vagina, manage as prolapsed cord .
 If fetal heart rate abnormalities persist or there are additional signs of distress (thick
meconium-stained fluid), plan delivery:
 If the cervix is fully dilated and the fetal head is not more than 1/5 above the symphysis
pubis or the leading bony edge of the fetal head is at 0 station, deliver by vacuum
extraction or forceps

Management
 Prop up the woman or place her on her left side.
 Stop oxytocin if it is being administered.
 Give oxygen 4–6 L by mask or nasal cannulae.
Advice on postpartum care
 To always have someone near her for the first 24 hours to respond to any change in her
condition.
 Not to insert anything into the vagina.
 To have adequate rest and sleep.
 The importance of hand washing to prevent infection of the mother and her baby.
 To wash perineum daily and after faecal excretion.
 To avoid sexual intercourse until the perineal wound heals.
 Counsel for birth spacing and family planning (for details see section on contraception).
 Advise on routine postpartum care visits-within the first week, preferably within 2-3 days
and second visit after 4-6 weeks. Earlier if problems- fever, UTI, perineal infection,
hypertension, urinary incontinence, severe anaemia, postpartum blues, HIV positive.
Counsel on exclusive breastfeeding
 Babies should start breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth. The baby should not be given
any other food or drink before breastfeeding.
 Babies should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life.
 Breast milk contains exactly the nutrients a baby needs, is easily digested and protects the
baby against infection."

PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME,"treatment when the symptoms are severe to interfere with the woman's lifestyle,
relationships and occupational functioning.
Salient features
 Somatic symptoms include feeling of bloating, bodyaches, breast tenderness,
headache, food cravings and poor concentration.
 Emotional symptoms include emotional hypersensitivity, depression, irritability,
mood swings, anxiety, tension, fear of loss of control and confusion.
 Diagnosis is confirmed by excluding the concomitant medical or psychiatric
disorders with which it may be confused (depending on the symptoms).
Non- pharmacological treatment
Life-style advice should be offered to all women as first line of treatment.
1. Daily charting of symptoms for two months.
2. Dietary modifications like: increase complex carbohydrate meals, reduce or eliminate,
especially in the luteal phase - salts, chocolate, caffeine and alcohol; and several small
meals per day.
3. Moderate regular aerobic exercise like brisk walk 1-2 miles per day for 4-5days/week.
4. Stress management courses/counseling.
Pharmacological treatment
1. Tab. pyridoxine 100 mg/day for 10-14 days (during luteal phase) (maximum daily dose is
150 mg) or Tab. Evening primrose oil 500 mg 3 times a day.

weight gain, breast tenderness), Tab. spironolactone 100 mg/day Or Tab. bromocriptine
1.25 - 5 mg/day in the luteal phase for mastalgia. (Common side effects are nausea and
vomiting. Tablet can be given vaginally if side effects are very severe.)
4. If no relief in symptoms with above measures in 2 - 3 cycles and symptoms are
predominantly emotional, then the following drugs are used preferably in consultation
with a psychiatrist: Tab. fluoxetine 5-20 mg/day
5. In non-responders to the above therapy, ovulation suppression may be beneficial; any
of the following can be used: Low dose combined oral contraceptive pills, 1 pill daily

DYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING (DUB),"Treatment (Acute bleeding-first episode)
I. Severe bleeding (hemodynamically unstable patient)
 IV line, fluid replacement, blood transfusion, oxygen inhalation and monitoring of vitals.
 Dilatation and curettage to arrest bleeding except in cases of puberty menorrhagia where
medical management is preferred. IV tranexamic acid can be tried before resorting to
surgical intervention.
II. Less severe bleeding (haemodynamically stable patient)
 High dose progestogen: norethisterone 10 mg 3 times a day until bleeding stops (not >3
days) followed by norethisterone 5-10 mg or medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg per
day for 21 days. Withdrawal bleeding occurs after 2-4 days of stopping the drug and
stops in 4-5 days. Or combined oral contraceptive pills (OCs) containing 50 mcg
ethinyloestradiol 1 pill 2 times a day for 7 - 10 days followed by progestins for 7-10 days,
followed by withdrawal bleeding.
III.If bleeding is not controlled with progestogens
Patient is having heavy bleeding for many days, endometrial curettage yields minimal
tissue, or when the patient has been on progestogen medication (OC's or Depot MPA) and
the endometrium is shallow and atrophic.
Treatment schedules of high dose oestrogens, depending on the severity of the bleeding the
following can be used:
1. Conjugated oestrogen 25 mg IV every 4 h till bleeding abates or for 12 h. Progestin

treatment is started at the same time.
2. Oral treatment conjugated oestrogen 1.25 mg or 2 mg oestradiol valerate given
orally every 4 h for maximum of 24 h followed by single daily dose for 7-10 days.
All treatments must he followed by progestin coverage (10 mg MPA daily) along with
oestrogen for 7 days.
Monitoring
Clinical monitoring by vital charting and observation of blood loss per vaginum
Treatment (Chronic DUB - not actively bleeding)
 Iron therapy: elemental iron maximum 60 mg 3 times a day
 Histopathological diagnosis is must before starting hormonal therapy in all cases except
puberty menorrhagia.
I. Anovulatory DUB
 If contraception is desired: OCPs for 3 - 6 cycles or norethisterone 5-10 mg.
 Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg 16-25th day of the cycle for 3-6 cycles.
 In cases of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia on histology norethisterone acetate 5 mg
three times a day or MPA 10 mg twice a day 5-25th day of cycle for 3-9 cycles
followed by repeat endometrial biopsy.
 If fertility desired: ovulation induction is advised.
 Levonorgestrel IUD can be offered after counseling and is beneficial in DUB.
II. Ovulatory DUB
 NSAIDs: mefenamic acid 500 mg 3 times a day for 3 -5 days during periods. Or
 Oral combined contraceptive pills if contraception is desired.
If the above treatment is not effective in first cycle patient should be referred for
tertiary care. Following treatment can be considered as an alternative to surgery:
 Tab. danazol 200 mg daily for 3 months.
 Levonorgestrel IUCD can be offered after counseling and is beneficial in DUB."
MENOPAUSE,"treatment
 Balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, semi-skimmed milk adequate in vitamins and
minerals. A reduction or avoidance of smoking and alcohol consumption.
 Exercise: walking or swimming for 20-30 min every day.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tab. calcium 1500 mg daily.
 Hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Rule out contraindications to HRT like
endometrial/breast cancer, acute phase myocardial infarction, undiagnosed breast
lump/abnormal vaginal bleeding and acute liver disease. Hypertension and diabetes if
present should be controlled before HRT is prescribed.
Oestrogen therapy
 For hysterectomized patients- conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625 -1.25 mg. or oestriol
1-2 mg is given daily 1-25th day every month or daily without any break. If symptoms
recur during drug free period then give continuous therapy. Or
 Transdermal oestradiol patch 50 or 100 mcg/day applied twice a week away from breast,
preferably on the shaved skin of buttock, thigh or legs (Limiting factor is local skin
reactions). Transdermal oestradiol patch is preferred in case of gall bladder disease,
hypertriglyceridimea, history of thromboembolism, poorly-controlled hypertension,
recent myocardial infarction, vascular diseases, migraine, chronic hepatic dysfunction,
malabsorption syndrome.
 Combined therapy with oestrogens and progestin in women with intact uterus.

i. Oestrogen therapy as above.
ii. Progestogen-medroxyprogesterone acetate 5 - 10 mg, or dihydrogesterone 10 - 20
mg or norethisterone 2.5 mg or 200 ml micronized progesterone is added from 13th to
25th days in cyclic sequential regimen and 1st to 12th of every month in continuous
sequential regimen.
If withdrawal bleeding is not acceptable then give continuous combined treatment (0.625 mg
conjugated equine oestrogen + 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate or 1 mg micronized
oestrogen + 100 mg micronized progesterone).
If conventional HRT is contraindicated
 Tab. Tibolone 2.5 mg per day (major side effects are weight gain, oedema, breast tenderness,
GIT symptoms and vaginal bleeding).
 In symptomatic elderly women with atrophic vaginitis and other urogenital symptoms who
do not desire long term HRT: Oestriol cream daily application of 0.5 g delivering 0.5 mg of
oestriol for 3 weeks followed by twice weekly application for 3 - 4 weeks.( Key indicator

cytology tests.
 Every woman at 30 years should undergo Pap smear at least once as it helps in diagnosis
of early cervical cancer (ICMR guidelines).
Screening for cervical cancer
Age group- 3 years after sexual activity, not later than 21years. In countries with limited
resources all women around the age of 30 years should have one Pap test.
Method
 Pap smear (or) VIA (visual inspection after application of 5%acetic acid) in countries
with limited resources.
Precautions -Prior to a pap smear
 Not to douche for 48 hours, or use vaginal cream for 1 week, abstain from coitus for 24
hours, smear to be done on 7th day after menstrual period
Technique
 PAP TEST includes samples from ecto-cervix and endo-cervix
 Use bivalved speculum

 Place the endocervical brush or cotton tipped swab and roll it firmly against the canal
 Remove the endocervical brush or cotton tipped swab and place samples on the glass
slide
 Place the spatula against the cervix with the longer protrusion in the cervical canal
 Rotate the spatula 360° firmly against the cervix, scrape the entire transformation zone
 Place the sample immediately from the spatula onto the glass slide and fix it (spray
fixative or placing it in a bottle of fixative –95% ethanol."
PSYCHIATRY DISORDERS,"treatment, and their
acceptance is also improving. Although psychopharmacology forms the backbone of
treatment in most psychiatric disorders, certain points need to be especially emphasized while
managing psychiatric patients:
1) The formation of a trusting, confidential, non-judgemental and empathetic doctor -patient
relationship is crucial to the practice of psychiatry.
2) Knowing the person as a whole rather than only his symptoms endorses patient
improvement.
3) The psychotic patient often loses his judgement and reality perception. Such patients
often have to be treated against their will.
4) Family has an important role in the causation and management of psychiatric disorders.
5) All patients do well with holistic treatment which includes psychopharmacology, other
biological treatments, psychotherapyandrehabilitation.
6) Psychiatric treatment often continues for a long period, so compliance is a major issue."
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS,"treatment
 Cognitive behaviorally oriented psychotherapy -understanding of illness, identification of
target symptoms, and development of strategies to cope up with these symptoms.
284
Psychiatry Disorders
 Rehabilitation of the patients in the form of supported employment, individualized job
development, ongoing job support, integration of vocational and mental health services.
 Social skills training, behavior based instructions, corrective feedback, and contingent
social reinforcement.
Pharmacological treatment
 Hospitalization is indicated in suicidal patients, non compliant patients, treatment
resistant cases and diagnostically difficult cases (Figure 1).
 Antipsychotics (typical and atypical) are the main treatment for such patients (Table 1).
 Co-administration of Tab. trihexyphenidyl (2 – 12 mg/day) is recommended with typical
antipsychotics.
 Benzodiazepines (Inj. lorazepam 2-4 mg, orally, IM or IV preparation) may be co-
administered in uncooperative patients initially.
 ECT (electro convulsive therapy) - electric shock of 100-120 volts may be given in
patients with associated suicidal intention and treatment resistant cases. It is given for 1-3
seconds under general anesthesia so that it produces short lasting generalized tonic clonic
convulsions.

Figure 1. Treatment guidelines for schizophrenia
Patienteducation
 Both, the patient and the primary caregiver should be explained that although
schizophrenia is a chronic illness and requires long term treatment, it can be effectively
treated in most cases.
 Mild to moderate side effects may develop to medications, but usually tolerance develops
to them.
 Medicines should not be stopped abruptly.
 Family should be encouraged to take up the responsibility for regular treatment and"
OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS,"treatment is similar as schizophrenia
Brief psychotic disorder
 Clinical features similar to schizophrenia
 Differs from schizophrenia in that duration of symptoms is less than 1 month
 Pharmacological treatment is similar to schizophrenia
287
Psychiatry Disorders
Delusional disorder
 Clinical features - characterized by single or multiple non bizarre (false fixed but feasible
beliefs)delusions of 1 month duration
 Differs from schizophrenia in that duration of delusions is 1 month and functioning and
behavior in other areas of life than delusional one is intact
 Insight oriented psychotherapy forms mainstay of treatment whereas Pharmacological
treatment is similar to schizophrenia
Schizoaffective disorder
 Symptoms of schizophrenia are present continuously and features of bipolar affective
disorder overlap
 Differs from schizophrenia by prominence of affective features
 Pharmacological treatment is with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers as in schizophrenia
and bipolar disorder respectively"
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER,"treatment
 Psychological factors are very important in the causing, maintaining as well as
improving depression. For holistic management of depression, some form of
psychotherapy should be co-administered.
288
Psychiatry Disorders
 Psychodynamic approach aims at promoting personality change through understanding of
major conflicts, achieving insight into defenses, ego distortions, providing role model
permitting cathartic relief or aggression.
 Cognitive behavioral approach aims at providing symptomatic relief through alteration of
target thoughts, identifying cognitive distortions, modifying erroneous assumptions,
promoting self control over thinking patterns.
 Interpersonal approach aims at providing symptoms relief through solving current
interpersonal problems, reducing stress involving family and work, improving
interpersonal communication skills.
Supportive approach with techniques such as catharsis, realistic problem solving is also
useful.
Pharmacological treatment
 Hospitalization is needed in severely suicidal patients, treatment resistant cases and non
compliant patients.
 SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are currently the drug of choice for
depression.
- Tab. fluoxetine - start with 20 mg/day increase to 40 mg/day, if no response in 4-6
weeks
- Tab. escitalopram - start with 10 mg/day depending on tolerability and gradually
increase upto 30mg/day
- Tab. sertraline - start with 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day depending on the severity of
symptoms in 1 HS dosage preferably and gradually increase to maximum of
300mg/day
 Tab. mirtazepine - start with 7.5 mg/day and gradually increase upto maximum 30
mg/day.
 Tricyclic antidepressants like Tab. imipramine for depression with somatic complaints.
Start with 25mg twice a day and gradually increase by 25 mg/day to maximum of 300
mg/day if no response (should be avoided in patients with heart disease, glaucoma,
benign prostatic enlargement and epilepsy).
 Antidepressant action takes about 2-3 weeks and needs to be continued for 6-9 months in
first episode and for longer period in recurrent depression.
 Initially benzodiazepines may need to be co-administered to manage insomnia and
anxiety.
 In cases of bipolar depression, there might be a sudden switch to mania in which case
anti-depressant should be withdrawn.
 ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy) is a very safe, effective and economical mode of
treatment and is indicated in severe depression with or without suicidal ideas, retarded
depression and resistant depression.
289
Psychiatry Disorders
Patient education
 Explain the nature of illness, consequences of untreated depression, suicidal risk, need for
adequate does for adequate duration and other supportive measures.
 The therapeutic response takes time to appear but side effects may appear earlier.
Common side effects of tricyclic antidepressants are dry mouth, constipation, postural
hypotension (giddiness), blurred vision, sweating, palpitation, tremors, delayed
micturition, sedation, etc.
 Common side effects of fluoxetine are agitation, headache, nausea or heartburn, tremors,
changes in sexual performance, blurred vision, dry mouth and loss of appetite."
BIPOLAR MOOD DISORDER,"treatment
 Psychoeducation, family therapy and rehabilitation for manic phases
 Psychotherapeutic measures same as in unipolar depression for depressive phases.
Pharmacological treatment (Figure 2, Table 2)
 Antipsychotics like risperidone and olanzapine are used as an adjuvant in treatment.
 Episode of depression is to be treated as in major depressive disorder but Tab.lamotrigine
25-100 mg is the treatment of choice.
 Prophylactic treatment: to be given to prevent recurrent episodes: Tab. lithium carbonate
900-1500 mg /day in divided doses or Tab. sodium valproate 600- 2000 mg /day in
divided doses or Tab. carbamazepine 600-1200 mg / day in divided doses

Patient education
 Emphasize about recurrent course of illness and not to get too much worried regarding
recurrences.
 Relapses can be treated as successfully as the first episode.
 When on lithium, advice to take plenty of fluids especially during summer; not to restrict
salt.
291
Psychiatry Disorders
 If fever, vomiting or diarrhea develops while on lithium, reduce the dose of lithium to
half and contact the physician or the psychiatrist."
INSOMNIA,"treatment may be given to increase
the duration of sleep.
 Stressful situation leading to insomnia or the symptoms of the causative illness can be
elicited on careful enquiry.
 Duration of symptoms may vary from few days to many months or years depending on the
cause.
Non pharmacological treatment
Sleep hygiene
 Keep a regular time for going to bed and arising up; avoid day time naps.
 Limit daily in-bed time to the usual amount present before the sleep disturbance
 Avoid large meals near bedtime; eat at regular times daily. No stimulant medication or
food beverages (caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, etc.) especially in the evenings.
 Mild to moderate physical exercise in the morning.
 Avoid evening stimulation: substitute radio or relaxed reading for television.
 Practice meditation or progressive muscular relaxation.
 Maintain comfortable sleeping conditions.
Treat the underlying cause. In both primary insomnia (where no cause is identifiable) and
insomnia due to other causes, management includes introducing good sleep hygiene and
medications for short period, if required.
Pharmacological treatment
If still sleep is inadequate,
 Tab. nitrazepam 5-10 mg or Tab. clonazepam 1-2mg or Tab. zopiclone 7.5-15mg or Tab.
zolpidem 5-10 mg can be given for 2-6 weeks, ½ to 1 hr before bedtime.
 Patients must be cautioned regarding risk of dependence in diazepam and nitrazepam.
Patienteducation
Follow sleep hygiene instructions, look for tapering off benzodiazepines in 4-6 weeks
292
Psychiatry Disorders"
GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER,"treatment
3 main psycho-therapeutic approaches are used.
 Cognitive behavior therapy aims at finding out the cognitive distortions and altering
faulty coping strategies. Major techniques used are relaxation and biofeedback.
 Supportive therapy aims at offering reassurance and comfort to the patients.
 Insight orientated psychotherapy focuses on uncovering unconscious conflicts and
identifying ego strengths.
Pharmacological treatment
 Benzodiazepines are the drug of choice like diazepam (start from 5mg HS or 10 mg HS),
or Tab. clonazepam (start from 0.5 mg HS or TDS depending on the severity of
symptoms), or Tab.lorazepam (start from 2 mg HS increase upto 8 mg maximum).
 SSRIs like sertraline, escitalopram or paroxetine (start with Tab. paroxetine 10 mg or 20
mgper day upto maximum 50 mg/day) is effective in GAD.
 Beta blockers (Tab. propranolol 20 mg BD or sustained release preparation upto 80
mg/day in divided doses is used) is used for symptomatic relief.
Patient education
 It is a chronic disease though easily treatable, but treatment needs to be taken regularly
for a long time.
 Do not stop treatment without consulting your doctor.
 The drugs are quite safe and do not cause any serious side effects even if taken for a long
time.
293
Psychiatry Disorders"
PANIC DISORDER,"treatment
Main approaches used are cognitive and behavioral therapies which aim at providing psycho
education and correcting cognitive distortions. It also includes educating the patient about
relaxation techniques and respiratorytraining.
 Family therapy includes providing psycho education and support
 Insight orientated psychotherapy is focused on helping patients to understand unconscious
meaning of anxiety and resolution of conflicts.
Pharmacological treatment
 SSRIs particularly paroxetine are effective in treating panic disorders. Other SSRIs like
escitalopram, citalopram, fluvoxamine and sertraline are also useful.
 Alprazolam is the most widely used benzodiazepine (start with 0.25 mg/day 1 HS upto
maximum of 6 mg/day). Theyare used for providing rapid symptomatic relief.
 Inj. lorazepam 2mg/ml and diazepam 5ml/ml can be used in patients presenting with
acute anxiety.
 Tri cyclic anti depressants like amitriptyline are also useful
Patient education
 General reassurance about benign nature of symptoms and possibility of spontaneous
recovery of individual
 Continuing with breathing exercises."
OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD),"treatment
 Behavioral therapy is considered as treatment of choice for OCD. Principle approaches
used are exposure and response prevention. Other techniques used are desensitization,
thought stopping, flooding, implosion therapy and aversive conditioning.
 Psychotherapy in form of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT), psychoanalytical and
psychodynamic therapies are also c+onsidered useful in the treatment.
 Resistant cases can also be treated by ECTs or surgeries.
Pharmacological treatment
 SSRIs like fluoxetine, fluoxamine, paroxetine (start with 10 mg gradually increase to
50mg/day), sertraline are agents of choice in treating OCD.
 Tab. clomipramine is start with 75mg sustained release preparation once daily and
depending on severity of symptoms gradually increase upto 300mg. It is the only
effective tricyclic anti-depressant used in treating OCD.
 Augmenting agents like sodium valproate, lithium or carbamazepine are added to enhance
the response to treatment.
 Benzodiazepines may be used as adjuvant treatment.
Patienteducation
 Reassure the patient that although disease is distressing and disabling, it is treatable.
 The drug takes about 2 weeks for its therapeutic response to manifest.
 Side effects may appear before the onset of therapeutic response. Common side effects of
clomipramine are dry mouth, constipation, postural hypotension (giddiness), blurred
vision, and sedation. Side effects of fluoxetine include gastrointestinal distress, nausea,
headache, nervousness, anorexia, restlessness and sexual side effects. Patient usually
adapts to these side effects with time.
 Advice the patient that treatment may continue for a long time. He/she should not leave
drugs without medical advice.
 In case of any untoward effects of drugs, he/she must immediately get in touch with his
clinician.
295
Psychiatry Disorders
 Patient must continue all his regular activities as far as possible.
 Yoga, meditation, physical exercises are useful measures along with drug therapy."
PHOBIC DISORDERS,"treatment
 Systematic desensitization is the most commonly used behavioral technique which
exposes patient to fearful stimulus in a serially graded manner. Imagined or actual
exposure to the phobic stimulus is given as long as the patient can tolerate.
 Insight orientated psycho therapy aims at enabling patients to understand the origin of
phobia, secondary gains and role of resistance and helps them to seek healthy ways of
coping with phobic stimuli.
 Hypnosis, supportive therapy and family therapyareuseful in treatment of phobias.
Pharmacological treatment
Following agents are used most commonly in treating phobias.
 SSRIs (e.g. Tab.paroxetine 12.5 -50 mg / day in divided doses)
 Benzodiazepines as mentioned above
Patient education
With regular treatment, most patients show improvement but treatment needs to be continued
for a long time, particularly in childhood onset phobias."
POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD),"treatment
Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy is aimed at giving psycho education to the patient
regarding the nature of typical emotional and physiological reactions to traumatic events and
PTSD. It also includes teaching techniques of muscle relaxation, focused breathing, affective
modulation, thought stopping and cognitive coping techniques to deal with the stress.
 Gradual exposure: The reminders of traumatic events are gradually introduced.
 Crisis Intervention/Psychological Debriefing: It consists of encouraging the patient to
describe the traumatic event in a supportive environment.
If the symptoms persist for more than a year, they do not improve after many years in one
third of patients; so early intervention and treatment is useful.
Pharmacological treatment
 SSRIs are the agents of choice for treating PTSD, the doses are same as in depression.
Propranolol has been used to treat PTSD symptomatically."
CONVERSION DISORDER,"treatment
 Spontaneous resolution of symptoms occurs but insight orientated, supportive or
behavioral therapies can facilitate the same.
 Hypnosis, psychodynamic and psychoanalytical approaches can also be useful.
 Benzodiazepines are used as an adjuvant therapy.
 SSRIs can be used if co morbid depression is present."
DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS,"Treatment
 Psychotherapeutic interventions like psychoanalytic psychotherapy, cognitive
psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy are the mainstay of treatment.
 Pharmacological treatment-antidepressants and antipsychotics have been used with
limited benefits."
ALCOHOL USE DISORDER,"treatment
 Motivation enhancing, individual, group and family therapy
Pharmacological treatment
 Hospitalization is advised to most patients for smooth detoxification and to avoid or
manage withdrawal complications including seizures and delirium tremens as well as
medical co-morbidities.
 Tab. chlordiazepoxide start from 25mg TDS and may be increased upto 100 mg/day, used
only if liver function tests are normal or
 Tab. lorazepam startingfrom 2 mgTDS increased upto 8 mg is used, preferred when liver
functions are compromised or not known.
 Tab. thiamine supplementation to prevent and treat vitamin deficiency (start from 75 mg
BD and can be increased upto 300 mg/day)
 Injectable vitamins can beused when signs of severe vitamin deficiency are present.
 Once the patient is stable, the dose should be gradually tapered off (20% per day) over a
period of 10 to 14 days.
299
Psychiatry Disorders
 Fluid and electrolyte disturbance should be corrected especially if there is vomiting or
fever.
 Seizures – Rum fits (appearing within 24 hours of abstinence) can be treated with Inj.
diazepam 10 mg or lorazepam 2 mg IV stat especially when seizures are repeated.
Prophylactic treatment is not recommended for true alcohol withdrawal fits.
 Delirium tremens –The patient should be preferably treated in an intensive care unit.
 An intravenous line should be started immediately and thiamine 100 mg IV should be
administered. Thiamine along with multivitamin should be continued parenterally till
normal diet is resumed.
 IV dextrose and saline should be given at a rate adequate to replace fluid losses and
maintain blood pressure.
 Hyperthermia should be managed with cold sponge. Tab. paracetamol 500 mg orally 4
times a day may be used in absence of any hepatic dysfunction.
 Inj. diazepam 10 mg should be given slowly IV and should be repeated every 15-20
minutes till sedation is achieved.
 Physical restraint may be necessary if the patient is combative.
 Associated medical and surgical problems should be simultaneously investigated and
treated appropriately.
 Tab. disulfiram (250mg to 500mg daily) is used for relapse prevention. Informed consent
for treatment with disulfiram is mandatory before administering it.
 Information about the disulfiram reaction and the potential lethality of the same is
explained.
Patient education
Education regarding short-term and long term complications (medical, psychological, social,
legal,etc.) of substance use."
OPIOID USE DISORDERS,"treatment
 Individual counseling, family support and encouraging the patient to join the self help
groups are also important to help him maintain long-term abstinence.
 However opiate dependence is a highly relapsing disorder, and prolonged inpatient stay in
settings that also provide rehabilitative inputs is usually beneficial.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tab. paracetamol 500 mg and dextropropoxyphen 32.5 mg - start from BD dosage and
gradually increase to 2 tablets TDS.
 Tab. buprenorphine 2 mg and naloxone 0.5 mg – start from 1 tablet BD to maximum of
TDS or QID dosages depending on the severity of withdrawal symptoms.
 Tab. clonidine 50 mcg BD is given for symptomatic management of withdrawal. Careful
monitoring of BP is needed.
 NSAIDs are given for muscular pains.
Long term (to be treated by a psychiatrist)
 Tab. naltrexone 50 mg/day orally is used to reduce craving and thereby to help patient
maintain long-term abstinence (who have remained opioid free for at least 7-10 days).
 Baseline hepatic functions should be assessed, and to be monitored once a month while
on naltrexone treatment.
 The drug is usually continued for a period of 6 months, however, it may have to be
withdrawn in presence of significant liver disease (i.e. several fold increase in the serum
levels of transaminases).
Patient education
Patient should be told about nature of illness, course and treatment modalities available
through individual sessions."
CANNABIS USE DISORDERS,"treatment is given for cannabis withdrawal.
Pharmacological treatment
Symptomatic treatment for nausea, insomnia and anxietymay be given
Non-pharmacological treatment
Motivation enhancing counseling, individual, family & group counseling
301
Psychiatry Disorders"
AUTISTIC DISORDER,"treatment
 Educational and behavioral interventions are the treatment of choice.
 Structured classroom training in combination with behavioral methods is the most
effective treatment for many autistic children.
 Behavioral therapies to reinforce socially acceptable behaviors and encourage self care
skills.
 Training of parents with regards to the concepts and skills of behavioral modification has
proved beneficial.
 Language development is added to facilitate communication.
Pharmacological treatment
 No medication has proven its efficacy in treatment of core symptoms of autism but
symptomatic treatment for hyperactivity, obsessions, compulsions, aggression and self
injurious behavior can be given by using escitalopram, methylphenidate, haloperidol,
risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine. Lithium can be used in self injurious behaviors.
 Guidelines for Tab. risperidone prescribing with autism spectrum disorders in children
and adolescents are as follows:
- Initiating dose at 0.25 mg per day for patients less than 20 kg and 0.5 mg per day for
patients weighing20 kg or more.
- On day 4, the dose may be increased by 0.25 mg for patients being less than 20 kg or
moreand by 0.5 mg for patients above 20 kg.
- Assess the response after 2 weeks."
ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER,"treatment
Social skills training, behavioral therapy and group therapy for patient and families are
considered beneficial.
Pharmacological treatment
 Drug of choice is Tab. methylphenidate 5-20mg.
 Other agents are atomoxetine, bupropion, venlafaxine, clonidine, guanfacine."
MENTAL RETARDATION,"treatment
No treatment measures are available except for those to control behavioural symptoms.
Preventive measures form an important strategy.
 Primary prevention
It is aimed at implementing measures such as to increase the knowledge and awareness
about MR, to ensure and upgrade public health policies and laws to provide optimal
health care to mother and child, to eradicate known disorders associated with CNS
damage, etc.
 Secondary and tertiary prevention
- It is aimed at treating the associated disorder if any to shorten the course of illness
(secondary prevention) and to minimize the sequelae or consequent disabilities
(tertiary prevention).
- Specialized educational programmes addressing the training & adaptive skills, social
skills and vocation should be developed to improve quality of life.
- Group therapyhas also been successful.
- Behaviour therapy to reinforce desired behaviours and to reduce objectionable
behaviours is considered useful.
- Cognitive therapies like dispelling false beliefs and relaxation exercises have been
recommended.
- Psychodynamic therapy has been used with patients and families to decrease conflicts
about unrealistic expectations.
 Family Education
Educating the family and providing them counseling and supportive help is an important
aspect of management of MR.
 Social Intervention
It is aimed at improving the quantity and quality of social competence of people with MR.
Pharmacological treatment
 Methylphenidate is used successfully for patients of MR with Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder.
 Antiepileptic agents like sodium valproate and carbamazepine are used for controlling
aggressive and self-injurious behaviour.
304
Psychiatry Disorders
 Antidepressants are used to treat comorbid depression and antipsychotics like haloperidol,
chlorpromazine are used for reducing stereotyped movements.
 Beta-blockers like propranolol are used to control explosive rages or anger outbursts.
 Development of special schools, supportive groups and NGOs form an essential part of
supportive strategies for people with MR."
SUICIDAL PATIENT,"treatment
Treatment is specifically directed at the cause, if identifiable. The patient should be referred
to a psychiatrist immediately after ensuring the following steps:
 Patient should not be left alone and be kept under constant observation.
 Family should be explained the seriousness of the problem and actively included in
management.
 Patient should be offered psychological support and reassurance and not criticized.
 No dangerous or potentially dangerous objects such as knife, blade, sharp edged objects,
rope, medication supply, etc. should be available in immediate vicinity of the patient.
 Specific treatment for depression, psychotic disorder or whatever may be the cause
should immediately be started.
Patient education
Family should be advised to follow a supportive approach towards the patient and should not
criticize. Suicidal attempt is indicative of distress and needs treatment of the causative illness.
305
Psychiatry Disorders"
PERSONALITY DISORDERS,"Treatment of personality disorders is difficult. Psychotherapies and pharmacological
treatment for symptomatic management can be used with restricted benefits.
307
Chapter 15"
OSTEOARTHRITIS,"treatment
 Weight reduction (if overweight); cold fomentation for acutely swollen knee, however,
hot fomentation may give symptomatic relief to some chronic patients.
 Supervised non-traumatic muscle conditioning and rehabilitation regimens e.g. isometric
quadriceps strengthening exercise (all vigorous exercises to be avoided in acutely
swollen/painful knee).
 Compressive bandage or crepe bandage for effusion.
 Assistive devices like cane (to be held in the hand contralateral to more painful side),
walker for patients with severe deformities or unsteady gait.
 Brace for various instability helps while walking.
Pharmacological treatment
 Topical applications- containing salicylates, capsaicin, nicotinates, menthol, camphor,
NSAlDs in various combinations may provide symptomatic relief. (Caution: Avoid hot
fomentation immediately after topical applications). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) for pharmacological pain palliation. The choice of NSAID depends upon
dosing convenience, physician and patients comfort, price and the past experience on its
frequency and severity of side effects as all are equipotent in full therapeutic dose (Avoid
intra-articular or oral steroids). Commonly used NSAlDs for OA knee
i. Acute painful situation/moderate pain (for initial 7-14 days), preferably take
NSAIDs after meals.
- Tab.paracetamol 500 mg 4-6 hourly(maximum daily dose 4000 mg)
- Tab. ibuprofen 400 -600 mg 2 or 3 times a day (maximum daily dose 3200 mg)
- Tab. diclofenac sodium 50 mg 3 times a day or 75 mg 2 times a day (maximum
daily dose 200 mg)
- Tab. aspirin 350 mg 2 tablets 4-6 hourly (maximum daily dose 5000 mg).
For mild to moderate pain/chronic pain control (for 3-6 weeks and then SOS)
308
Orthopedic Conditions
- All above medicines in reduced frequency of dosages. Or
- Tab.diclofenac sodium 100 mg/75 mg sustained release once a day. Or
- Tab.piroxicam 20 mgonce a day.
 All patients do not uniformly respond to a particular NSAID. It is not unusual for several
different NSAIDs to be tried before a suitably effective and well-tolerated agent is
identified for a particular patient.
 Caution: NSAIDs may cause dose related gastric irritation, nausea, vomiting and
dyspepsia; GI ulceration, perforation and haemorrhage and sometime renal toxicity.
However, one-third remains asymptomatic. NSAIDs can interfere with antihypertensive
therapy due to salt and water retention)
 In case of epigastric burning or nausea or vomiting either discontinue and switch over to
safer NSAID or administer Cap. omeprazole 20 mg half an hour before breakfast, in
patients on prolonged therapy with NSAIDs monitor haemoglobin, stool for occult blood
as these drugs may also cause leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis.
"
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS,"treatment
 Since the etiology of RA is unknown, therapy remains empirical and palliative, aimed at
relieving the signs and symptoms of the disease.
 In acute pain rest and splint. Otherwise exercises directed at maintaining muscle strength
and joint mobility without exacerbating joint inflammation. A variety of orthotic (splints)
and assistive devices (cane, walker) can be helpful in supporting and aligning deformed
joints to reduce pain and improve function.
Pharmacological treatment
 In acute inflammation any of the NSAIDs as given in section on osteoarthritis may be
given except paracetamol. The anti-inflammatory action of the NSAIDs may take 2-4
weeks to become evident. Evaluation of persistent polyarthritis.
 Reduced NSAID dosages have to be used in the elderly and in patients with impaired
renal function. Concomitant use of more than one NSAID only increases toxicity, and has
no additional benefit. Patient not responding to one NSAID may still show a good
response to another.
 Topical applications-containing salicylates, capsaicin, nicotinates, menthol, camphor and
NSAIDs in various combinations may provide symptomatic relief.
"
CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPONDYLOSIS,"treatment
 In acute painful situation rest, moist heat in cold weather and light massage (improves
tone, circulation and elasticity) to paraspinal muscles. Cervical traction in the position of
maximum comfort to neck (5-10 pounds) for 10-15 minutes. Ultrasonic exposure on
painful trigger points in cervical and shoulder muscles. Inter ferential therapy (IFT) for
acute neck and back pain. Removable soft cervical collar/back corset/ back belt for
symptomatic relief.
(Caution: No exercises in acute painful situation).
 In chronic pain mobilization and strengthening exercises, moist heat and cervical traction.
Pharmacological treatment
Same as described for osteoarthritis of knee.
Patient education
 In cervical spondylosis avoid prolonged desk work, if must, then intermittent rest is
required and proper writing, typing, sitting posture (avoid low table, use tilt table) and
care of the neck.
 In lumbar spondylosis explain the patient how to manage weight since extra weight puts
greater stress on the back muscles and to maintain proper body alignment while standing
with feet slightly apart. When standing for long periods, use a small stool to keep one foot
up with knee bent. Do not tense up or concentrate on standing up straight, just stand
naturally. Try to avoid carrying heavy bags on shoulders.
 Care of back while sitting by using well designed fully adjustable chair to provide plenty
of support to the lower back. If chair is uncomfortable use a rolled up towel or small
pillow to support the back. When sitting for long periods rest your feet on low stool and
use arm rests to support weight of your body. Try not to sit in the same position for long
periods. If prolonged sitting is must take rest for a minute or two every hour.
 To lift weight cautiously by keeping the back as much upright (vertical) and straight (not
hunched over) as one can. Not to bend over at waist to pick up the object, instead squat,
get under or next to object not on top of it. Lift with your leg muscles rather than back or
abdominal muscles. Hold the object close to your body while lifting and carrying and do
not twist your body.
 To sleep safely on a firm bed. While sleeping supine legs should be supported with
pillows. Not to sleep on your stomach. Sleeping on your side with knees bent and hips
tilted forward is probably the best.
"
SPRAINS,"treatment
 Check sensation and circulation distal to the injury. Obtain X-rays of the involved region
to rule out a fracture. Stress X-rays may show abnormal opening of the joint in a grade III
sprain.
 Protection, support and rest.
 Restrict the movement of the affected area.
 Apply cold compresses immediately (this will help to reduce swelling).
 Avoid using ice directlyon the skin.
 Elevation of the limb above the level of the heart- especially at night while sleeping.
 In a grade I sprain, apply a compression bandage for a period of 5-7 days, patient may be
allowed to bear weight after a week.
 In a grade II sprain, splintage (slab later on converted to cast) may be used to restrict joint
motion, but the patient has to remain non-weight bearing for 4-6 weeks.
Pharmacological treatment
 Tab. ibuprofen 400 mg 3 times a day for 5-7 days. Or Tab. diclofenac sodium 50 mg 3
times a day for 5-7 days.
Patient education
 Don't massage or hot fomentation in acute stage; it will increase the swelling.
 To give rest to the injured area until the pain subsides (usually 7 to 10 days for mild
sprains and 3 to 5 weeks for severe sprains).Avoid activities that cause pain or swelling.
Practice moderation in physical activities. If the pain and swelling decreases within 48
hours after a sprain, move the affected joint in all directions. To avoid high heeled shoes
(for ankle sprains).

Orthopedic Conditions"
ACUTE PYOGENIC OSTEOMYELITIS,"treatment
 Rest, splintage to the part, elevation of the limb and sponging for fever. If aspiration is
positive for pus, drain the pus (must be performed by an orthopaedic surgeon) and send
for culture and sensitivity for antibiotics.
 Postoperative duration of splintage depends upon extent of damage to the bone. Usual
duration is 4-6 weeks. Gradually mobilize the limb and permit gradual weight bearing
thereafter. In case of extensive destruction, bone might require support for a few months.
Pharmacological treatment
Broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics are started depending upon most likely organism
present. Commonest bacterial pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus (40-80% of cases). The
antibiotic later on may be changed depending upon culture report or response to therapy.
Intravenous administration of antibiotics is continued till favorable clinical response is
achieved, followed by oral antibiotics. Total duration of antibiotic(s) administration ranges
from 4-6 weeks.

every6hours. Alternatively linezolid can be given in appropriate dose.
 Oral Tab.paracetamol 500 mg for fever.
 Monitor therapy by clinical response. Favourable response characterized by decrease in
swelling and fever, improvement in general well being and movements of limb, fall in
ESR and C-Reactive protein (better indicator than ESR because CRP closely follows the
clinical response). After 7-10 days of symptoms, repeat the X-ray to assess the extent of
destruction and damage to bone. Oral therapy usually started 1-2 weeks of IV antibiotic
therapy, if response is favourable.
 The choice of oral antibiotic largely depends on culture and sensitivity report. In the
absence of culture report give oral: Syr./Cap. cloxacillin 50-100 mg kg day in 4 divided
doses for 3-4 weeks. Or Syr./Cap. cephalexin 25-50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3-4

ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS,"treatment
 Keep the joint in position of comfort.
 Aspiration of the joint for gram staining, culture and sensitivity.
 If aspirate is purulent, drainage of the joint on an emergency basis.
 Drain the joint even if the joint aspiration is doubtful in the presence of a strong clinical
suspicion, because the risks of negative arthrotomy are far too less than not draining an
infected joint having pus. The latter situation may be disastrous for the joint resulting in
lifelong permanent disability to the patient.
 After drainage splint the joint with a POP slab or skin traction to relieve pain and prevent
contractures till the patient is a febrile, pain free and the joint is clinically quiescent.
Intermittent mobilization is permitted to preserve the range of movement of the joint.
Pharmacological treatment
The choice of antibiotics, duration of therapy and monitoring of the therapy are same as
mentioned in the section on acute pyogenic osteomyelitis.

III.POSTOPERATIVE PNEUMONIA
 Pulmonary disorders remain the most frequent postoperative problem and 10- 15% of
patients are considered to have clinically significant chest complication after surgery
under general anaesthesia.
 Factors predisposing to increased chest complications are smoking, obesity, chronic
restrictive and obstructive lung disease, prolonged general anaesthesia and presence of
nasogastric tube. Postoperative pneumonia is caused by pathogens such as Pseudomonas,
Serratia,Klebsiella, Proteus andStreptococcus
Salient features

 Inj.diclofenac75mg1M every6-8hours.
 Chest physiotherapy
 Nebulized bronchodilators maybe used ifbronchospasm is present.
Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery
The goals ofprophylactic administrationof antibioticsto surgical patients are to:
 Reduce the incidence of surgical site infection;
320
Surgery
 Use antibiotics in a manner that is supported by evidence of effectiveness; minimize the
effect of antibiotics on the patient's normal bacterial flora; adverse effects.
Prophylaxis is uniformly recommended for all clean-contaminated, contaminated and
dirty procedures. It is considered optional for most clean procedures, although it may be
indicated for certain patients and clean procedures that fulfill specific risk criteria. It is
important to emphasize that surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is an adjunct to, not a
substitute for goodsurgical technique.
 Antibiotics prophylaxis should be regarded as one component of an effective policy for
the control of hospital acquired infection in procedure that requires the insertion of
implants or prosthetic devices, the term. Surgical site infection is used to encompass the
surgical wound and the implant. Surgical site infection also encompasses infections
involving the body cavity (e.g. subphrenic abscess), bones, joints, meninges and other
tissues involved in the operation. Throughout this guideline the term surgical site
infection (SSl) is used, unless the evidence relates specifically to surgical wound
infection."
SURGICAL SITE INFECTION,"treatment
 The antibiotics selected for prophylaxis must cover the common pathogens. Antibiotics
election is influenced by the organism most commonly causing wound. Infection in the
specific procedure and by the relative costs of available agents.
 Gastrointestinal procedures, oral and intravenous administration of agents with activity
against gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are warranted, as well as mechanical
preparation of the bowel. Ceftriaxone/cefotaxime provides adequate coverage for most
other types of procedures. The antibiotics chosen for prophylaxis can be those used for
active treatment of infection. However, the chosen antibiotics must reflect local disease-
specific information about the common pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
A past history of a serious adverse event should preclude administration of a particular
antibioticlike penicillin.
Timing and duration of prophylaxis
 The first dose should always be given before the procedure, preferably within 30 minutes
before incision. Re-administration at one to two half-lives of the antibiotic is
recommended for the duration of the procedure. In general, postoperative administration
is not recommended.
 There may be situations where overriding factors alter the normal timing of
administration. For example, during a caesarean section prophylaxis should be delayed
until the cord is clamped in order to prevent the drug reaching the neonate. When a
tourniquet is to be applied the necessary tissue concentration must be achieved prior to its
application rather than the time of incision. This probably occurs within10 minutes of
administration of an IV antibiotic injection. Antibiotics should also be administered
immediately after unexpected contamination of the tissues additional doses during the
operation.
The individual surgeon should be free to give an extra dose for prolonged operations with
major blood loss if they wish. However, there is insufficient evidence to make a general
recommendation. Antibioticprophylaxis should be confined to the perioperative period.
322
Surgery
Route of administration
Intravenous administration of antibiotic prophylaxis immediately before or after induction of
anesthesia is the most reliable method for ensuring effective serum antibiotic concentrations
at the time of surgery.
Dose selection
A single dose of antibiotic at the therapeutic concentration is sufficient for prophylaxis under
most circumstances. In adults, blood loss of up to1500 ml duringsurgery or haemodilution up
to 15 ml/kg does not require an additional dose of prophylactic agent.
In the event of major intraoperative blood loss (>1500ml) additional doses of prophylactic
antibiotic should be given after fluid replacement. Antibiotic prophylaxis in all cardiac
surgeries and interventions is recommended.

Surgery
Infection risk factors: Factors associated with increased risk of infection are:
Systemic factors: Diabetes, corticosteroid use, obesity, extremes of age, malnutrition, recent
surgery, massive transfusion, multiple (3 ormore) preoperative co morbid medical diagnoses
Local factors: foreign body, electrocautery; injection with epinephrine; wound drains; hair
removal with razor; previous irradiation of site.
Development of local guidelines
It is advisable to make local surgical site infection prevention protocols be developed by local
hospital management.
Postoperative wound management
 Most postoperative wounds are covered with occlusive dressings The occlusive dressing
(semi permeable to water vapours and oxygen but impermeable to liquids) consists of a
hydrating layer (antibiotic ointments or petroleum jelly), a non-adherent contact layer, an
absorbent and cushioning layer(gauze), and a se curing layer like hypo allergic tape.
Occlusive dressings should be applied within 2 hours of wounding and left on for at least 24
hours for optimal healing to occur for acute wounds. These should never be used on infected
wounds. Dressing changes can be performed once or twice daily. If other types of occlusive
are used, the timing of the dressing changes will vary between I to 7 days, depending on the
wound characteristics."
WOUNDCARE,"Treatment
Meticulous wound care includes adequate cleansing, debridement, oedema control and
prevention of ischemia,
Acute wounds
 The overall objective in caring for wounds that are incompletely clotted is to minimize
unnecessaryblood loss and to avoid the formation ofa hematoma.
 Irrigate gently with copious quantities of water or normal saline. Debris and necrotic tissue
should be removed without damaging healthy tissue. Sharp mechanical debridement may be
necessary to expose viable tissue for large areas of fibrinous exudates or eschar. Chemical
debridement is useful for those areas that are difficult to access by sharp debridement.
Chemical debridement of the wounds may be done using topical antiseptics (chlorhexidine,
povidoneiodine, alcohol, hydrogenperoxide, triclosan) and antibacterials (silver sulfadiazine,
neomycin, polymyxin, bacitracin, mupirocin).When debridement is complete, dressings can
be applied.
 Healing of acute wound is further facilitatedby closure. Alternatively,closure can be delayed
for several days to allow infection to clear. Wound healing is impaired by malnutrition,
oedema, bacterial contamination, ischemia, smoking and immunosuppressant.
Chronic wounds
Identify and treat the predisposing factors, e.g. diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial or venous
disease, severe anemia, protein deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic vasculitis, cushing’s
syndrome andconditions requiringsystemic steroid therapy.
325
Surgery
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Encourage daily or twice a day bath, to avoid walking bare foot or with slippers and patient
should been courage to wear shoes and socks.
 Patients with leg ulcer to reduce standing or excessive walking. In leg ulcer due to chronic
venous insufficiency or oedema, patients should be advised to wear elastic stockings,
elevation of leg and foot end of the bed while a sleep along with some leg exercises to
activate the calf muscle pump.
Pharmacological treatment
Identify the microorganism and treat accordingly. Tubercular ulcer is treated with anti tubercular
drug (2HRZE+7HR) for at least 9 months.
Surgical treatment
 Surgical debridement in ulcer associated with necrotic tissue or slough. Clean the wound
with physiological normal saline or tap water only (antiseptics delay wound healing).
 Daily dressing: Gauze adhere to the wound bed and it may remove viable tissue from the
wound surface on removal , resulting in delayed wound healing. Some of the commonly used
dressings are:
 Occlusive (moist ureretentive) dressings (Hydrocolloid gel) in case of clean and shallow
ulcers without any pus discharge or other features of infection. Occlusive dressings have
barrier properties that enable to prolong the presence of moisture and wound fluid in the
wound bed.
 Calcium alginate dressing: For bleeding wounds and wounds with a cavity.
Patient education
 To prevent ulcer in future, explain about the care of leg ulcers, wearing socks, shoes and
compression stocking.
 Good personal hygiene (daily bath) and after bath the healed scar area should be massaged
with an emollient cream such as lanolin or some other oil to keep the scar tissue soft and
supple and prevent further breakdown.
 Regular use of calf muscle activating exercises and leg elevation and to avoid prolonged
period of standing or sitting with legs down. In case of diabetic patients, control of diabetes is
necessary."
SUTURING OF PRIMARY WOUND,"treatment
 Inj. tetanus toxoid 0.5 ml IM stat
327
Surgery
 Inj. diclofenac sodium 3 ml (75mg) IM stat
 Tab. ampicillin 500 mg three times day for 3-5 days
 Tab. diclofenac 50 mg twice day for 3-5 days
 Tab. multivitamins/Iron if patient is deficient of any for better healing
 Control of Diabetes mellitus, if present
 Management of local wound: if wound is recent(<6 hrs) cleaning followed by suturing is
done. If duration of injury is >6 hrs, and contamination is present, wound is debrided and
wound is closed by secondary suturing at a later date when wound is clean.
 For primary suturing: Thorough cleaning of wound by saline/Hydrogen Peroxide/Betadine.
 Removal of any foreign material and control of active bleeding.
Choice of suturematerial
The size of suture material is measured by its width or diameter and is vital to proper wound
closure.
 1-0 and 2-0: Used for high stress areas requiring strong retention, i.e. -deep fascia repair
 3-0: Used in areas requiring good retention, i.e. -scalp, torso, and hands
 4-0: Used in areas requiring minimal retention, i.e. extremities. Is the most common size
utilized for superficial wound closure.
 5-0: Used for areas involving the face, nose, ears, eyebrows, and eyelids.
 6-0: Used on areas requiring little or no retention. Primarily used for cosmetic effects
Suture Techniques: Wound layers should be placed in close approximation. Minimal amount of
tension across the suture line should be kept. Wound edges should be slightly everted. Equal
bites, horizontally and vertically are important for wound position and healing. Debride
devitalized tissue. Alternate day dressing with antiseptic solution till suture removal
Suture removal
 Duration will vary according to the location and depth of the wound. However, the average
time frame is 7-10 days after application. The following general rules can be sued in deciding
when to remove sutures:
 Face: 4-5 days.
 Body & scalp: 7 days.
 Soles, palms, back or over joints: 10 days
 Any suture with pus or signs of infections should be removed immediately. Once MO
determines that the sutures should be removed, a suture removal kit, consisting of scissors
and a pair of tooth forceps is utilized to remove the sutures.
 Using the tooth forceps, grasp the knot and snip the suture below the knot with the scissors as
close as possible to the skin. Pull the suture line through the tissue and place on a 4x4. Once
all sutures have been removed count the sutures. The number of sutures needs to match the

BRONCHIAL ASTHMA,"treatment.
Salient features
 Precipitating allergens are dust, pollen, fish, nuts, strawberries, cold air, tobacco smoke,
viral and bacterial infections, exercise, emotional stress and drugs like NSAIDs, aspirin,
beta-blocker
 Classical symptoms include cough, breathlessness, chest tightness and wheezing. Signs
include tachypnoea, tachycardia, pulsus paradoxus, use of accessory muscles, silent chest
Diagnosis
 When asthma is suspected and other disorders have been ruled out (e.g. tumours in adults,
foreign body in children; don’t assume the presence of wheeze means asthma), confirm
the diagnosis with pulmonary function tests (PFTs).
 PFTs suffice as objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:
A 12 % or greater improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) in children and
adults, and > 200 ml in adults from the baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled
-
short-acting beta2 agonist.
Serial measures of peak expiratory flow (PEF): A > 20% change after administration
of a bronchodilator.
-
 When there is some probability of asthma and the above tests are non-diagnostic, the
following tests may be used to help diagnosis of asthma:
Methacholine challenge
Exercise challenge
-
Inhaled corticosteroid trial: appropriate doses of inhaled steroids for 4-6 weeks
-
Raised value of absolute eosinophil count (>6-8%)
-
Non pharmacological treatment
-
 Evaluate and assess impact and exposure to allergens and irritants in individual patients.
 Complete cessation of smoking and avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke is
strongly recommended.
 Lifestyle management-"
CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE,"treatment
 General Medical Care - Patients with COPD should receive the influenza vaccine
annually. Polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine is also recommended, although proof of
efficacyis not definitive.
 Pulmonary Rehabilitation-This refers to a treatment program that incorporates education
and cardiovascular conditioning. In COPD, pulmonary rehabilitation has been
demonstrated to improve health-related quality of life, dyspnea, and exercise capacity and
reduce rates of hospitalization over a 6-to 12-month period.
 Lung Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS) offers both a mortality benefit and a
symptomatic benefit in certain patients with emphysema. Patients with upper lobe–
355
Respiratory Diseases
predominant emphysema and a low post rehabilitation exercise capacity are most likely to
benefit from LVRS.
 Lung Transplantation - COPD is currently the second leading indication for lung
transplantation Current recommendations are that candidates for lung transplantation
should be <65 years; have severe disability despite maximal medical therapy; and be free
of co-morbid conditions such as liver, renal, or cardiac disease.
Pharmacological treatment (Table 5)
 Bronchodilators- Used for symptomatic benefit in patients with COPD. The inhaled route
is preferred for medication delivery as the incidence of side effects is lower than that seen
with the use of parenteral medication delivery.
 Theophylline produces modest improvements in expiratory flow rates and vital capacity
and a slight improvement in arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in patients with
moderate to severe COPD. Nausea is a common side effect; tachycardia and tremor have
also been reported. Monitoring of blood theophylline levels is typically required to
minimize toxicity.
 Supplemental oxygen is the only pharmacologic therapy demonstrated to unequivocally
decrease mortality rates in patients with COPD. Patients with resting hypoxemia (resting
O saturation 88% or <90% with signs of pulmonary hypertension or right heart failure)
2
require continual oxygen supplementation. Various delivery systems are available,
including portable systems that patients may carry to allow mobility outside the home.
Supplemental O are commonly prescribed for patients with exertional hypoxemia or
2
nocturnal hypoxemia.
 Glucocorticoids are not routinely recommended.
 Other agents that can be used as follows: N-acetyl cysteine 600 mg TDS for 10 to 14 days

nebulizer use, for which doses may vary.
 Only three interventions—smoking cessation, oxygen therapy in chronically hypoxemic
patients, and lung volume reduction surgery in selected patients with emphysema—have
been demonstrated to influence the natural history of patients with COPD.
 All other therapies are directed at improving symptoms and decreasing the frequency and
severity of exacerbations. The institution of these therapies should involve an assessment
of symptoms, potential risks, costs, and benefits of therapy.
Acute exacerbation of COPD (Table 6)
 An exacerbation of COPD is an acute event characterized by a sustained worsening of
any of the patient’s respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum quantity and/or character,
dyspnea) that is beyond normal day-to-day variation and leads to a change in medication,
and where other causes of acute breathlessness have been clinically excluded.

BRONCHIECTASIS,"treatment (Table 10)
The treatment of bronchiectasis may be medical or surgical. Medical treatment aims to
relieve and control the symptoms, whereas surgical treatment is intended to eliminate the
disease itself. The main arms of medical treatment are control of lower respiratory tract
infection/inflammation with appropriate antibiotic treatment and the removal of bronchial
secretions by postural drainage

Complications
 Infective exacerbations occurring in patients with bronchiectasis are marked by both
increased volume and purulence of sputum. They may follow upper respiratory tract
infections in much the same way as exacerbations of chronic bronchitis.
362
Respiratory Diseases
 Haemoptysis occurs commonly in bronchiectasis. Such episodes are usually small,
although major (>200mL per 24h) or rarely massive (>1000mL per 24h) haemoptyses
may occur.
 Chronic paranasal sinusitis occurs in a high percentage of patients with bronchiectasis and
is very common in severe cases.
 Brain abscess, operative complications include haemorrhage, atelectasis, pneumonia,

-
 Segmental breathing = keeping the hands on the segment which is to be treated and
asking the Patient to fill the air under the hands.
Pursed lip breathing = inhaling through nose and exhaling through pursed lips.

363
Respiratory Diseases
ACBT (Active Cycle of Breathing Technique): It consists of repeated cycles of 3
ventilatory phases: breathing control, thoracic expansion and FET (Forced
-
Expiratory Techniques)
AD (Autogenic Drainage): It uses diaphragmatic breathing to mobilize secretions by
varying expiratory airflow.
-
Postural Drainage along with Percussion Vibration and Shaking: In PD Patient is
placed in positions that allow the bronchopulmonary trees to be drained with
-
assistance of gravity.
Manual Hyperinflation: It is used in patients on endotracheal tube or tracheostomy
two caregivers are needed one to use the bag to hyperinflate the lung during
-
inspiration and provide a quick release to allow rapid exhalation. And second to apply
shaking or vibrations at beginning of expiration.
Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP): It consists of a mouthpiece to which one way
valve is connected which is attached with expiratory resister which provides pressure
-
during expiration which helps in avoiding the collapsing airway and remove the
secretions.
High Frequency Chest Compression (HFCC): It is used to give oscillations and
compressions to whole lungs in sitting position helps in mucus clearance.
-
In diseases like Pleural Effusion the fluid gets accumulated in the pleural cavity so for
that positioning in such a way that gravity assists the drainage of fluid faster through

NEWBORN CARE,"Treatment
Establishment of breathing at birth
 Most newborns cry immediately at birth and therefore need no assistance to establish
breathing. If the baby is preterm, meconium stained or some evidence of infection, not
crying or breathing or with poor muscle tone, then proceed to initial steps of resuscitation.
 For term babies, use 100% oxygen when baby is cyanotic or when positive pressure
ventilation is required. If room air is being used, supplementary oxygen should be
available to use if there is no appreciable improvement within 90 seconds of birth. If
supplemental oxygen is not available, positive pressure ventilation should be continued
with room air.
 Infants without signs of life (no heart beat and no respiratory effort) after 10 minutes of
resuscitation show either a high mortality or severe neurodevelopmental disability. After
10 minutes of continuous and adequate resuscitative efforts, discontinuation of
resuscitation may be justified if there are no signs of life.
Hypothermia
 Identification of hypothermia. An axillary (or rectal) temperature <36.0°C is
hypothermia. Such a baby would feel cold to touch on the abdomen and periphery.
 Identification of cold stress: Baby's peripheries are cold but abdomen is warm. This
usually corresponds to axillary temperature of 36-36.4°C.
 Prevention of hypothermia.
- Dry the baby with warm dry linen at birth. Discard wet linen and wrap in dry linen.
Place baby after birth under a radiant warmer or 200 Watt bulb (placed at a distance of 45 cm
above the baby). If neither is available, place the newborn infant on the mother's chest
365
Pediatric Conditions
and wrap baby and mother together to prevent heat loss from the exposed skin surfaces of
the baby.
- Ensure that there are no open windows or fans turning in the delivery
area where baby is being delivered or being observed.
- Suction mouth and then nose with mucous sucker
- Delay bathing of newborn for the first few days; this will prevent hypothermia. However,
baby may be wiped with warm clean water to remove dried blood, vernix or secretions.
Care must be taken to ensure that the room is warm and draught free when the baby is
being cleaned or bathed. The baby should immediately be wrapped in dry linen after
being wiped dry.
 After birth and for the first few days thereafter keep mother and baby in close proximity
with baby being adequately clothed. In cold weather, the baby must have 2 layers of
cotton vest with a woolen sweater, cap, socks and legs should be covered and baby should
be wrapped in a blanket. In summer, cotton dress with a cotton diaper wrapped in a
cotton cloth.
Prevention of infection
 Always clean hands with soap and water and wear sterile gloves if available before
conducting the birth of the baby and while examining babies during the first few days of
life.
 A sterilized blade (if that is not available a new razor blade or a blade boiled for at least
20 minutes) must be used for cutting the cord at delivery. The cord tie used must be
sterile or boiled for 20 minutes before used for tying the cord after birth.
 The surface for conducting delivery and placing the baby after birth must be clean.
 Do not apply anything to the cord or eyes after birth.
 Do not give prelacteal feeds. Give exclusive breast-feeding from birth.
Exclusive breastfeeding
 Advise mothers to start breast feeding within one hour of birth. Not to give any prelacteal
feeds such as honey, water, etc.
 Give breast feeds to baby on demand. Give the baby exclusive breast feeding for at least
first 6 months of life. However, there may be situations where it may not be possible to
provide human milk i.e., maternal death, severe maternal illness, HIV positive mothers
and documented lactational inadequacy.
 Not to give water to the baby during period of exclusive breast feeding.
Early identification of high-risk newborns
 Babies born to mothers with eclampsia, antepartum haemorrhage, diabetes etc. are
considered as high-risk newborns and delivery should be conducted at a centre where all
facilities for the care of the newborn are available. The following examination at birth or
during the first few days would help detect high risk babies who are in need of immediate"
LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES,"Treatment
Indications for hospitalization are:
 Birth weight of less than 1800 g, gestation age of less than 34 weeks , neonate who is not
able to take feeds from the breast or by cup (katori) and spoon (irrespective of birth
weight and gestation), sick neonate (irrespective of birth weight and gestation).
Keep the LBW babies warm
Room temperature should be kept between 28-30°C. Following methods may be used:
 Maternal-baby skin to skin contact (Kangaroo mother care). Place the naked baby
between the mother's breasts. Wrap baby and mother with a shawl. Cover the baby's head
with a cap.
 Proper clothing - cap, woollen sweaters, socks and mittens. Blankets, Overhead radiant
warmer, Incubator

NEONATAL JAUNDICE,"Treatment
All neonates need assessment for jaundice. But not all jaundiced neonates require treatment.
 Phototherapy:
- Mainstay of treatment and usually initiated when total serum bilirubin level reached
phototherapy threshold (10 to 12 mg/dl for preterm and 15 mg/dl for term babies).
- The naked infant (with covered eyes) is kept about 45 cm below the phototherapy unit.
Phototherapy is administered continuously and interrupted only for nursing and feeding
purpose with change in position every 2-4 hours.
- Failure of phototherapy is defined as inability to observe a decline in bilirubin of 1-2
mg/dl after 4-6 hour and/or to keep the bilirubin level below the exchange transfusion
level.
 Exchange transfusion:
- It is indicated when bilirubin level exceeds threshold levels for age and gestational age or
have features of bilirubin encephalopathy.
- Choice of blood: Group and type specific, compatible packed RBCs with anticoagulant,
<7 days old.
- Complications include hypothermia, fluid overload, infection, electrolyte imbalance,
hypoglycaemia, thrombosis and death.
- Monitoring of heart rate, saturation, respiration, temperature, glucose and bilirubin levels
is required.
 Adjunct treatment:
- Intravenous immunoglobulin
- Phenobarbitone"
IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA,"treatment
 After period of exclusive breastfeeding (6 months), cereal based diet should be added.
Encourage green leafy vegetables and fruits.
 Treatment depends on hemoglobin levels and age of the patients
Pharmacological treatment-Oral Iron Therapy
 Oral ferrous salts (sulphate, gluconate etc) are the preferred therapeutic iron preparations.
 Therapeutic iron dose: 4 mg/kg/day of elemental iron in 2 – 3 divided doses to be given
between meals for 2 months after normal Hb concentration for age is achieved.
 In prematurity start iron syrup from 2nd week of life to 1 year.
 Response to therapy – decreased irritability and improved appetite is seen within 12 – 24
hours. Rise in Hb levels seen within 7 days at the rate of 0.25 –0.4 g/dl/day.
373
Pediatric Conditions
 If the response is inadequate, check for the prescribed dose, compliance, presence of
diarrhoea or malnutrition, infections or β thalas semia trait mistakenly diagnosed as iron
deficiency anaemia.
Parenteral Iron Therapy
 It is rarely required. However, when oral iron is not tolerated, severe ADRs to oral iron or
presence of malabsorption syndromes, parenteral iron therapy may be used.
 Total dose of iron is: Iron(mg) = wt(kg) x Hb deficit (g/dl) x 4
 Injection iron dextran or iron sorbitol citrate (50 mg/ml) deep gluteal IM injection is
preferred.
Blood Transfusion
 When Hb is less than 3g% or Hb 4-6 g% in cardiac compromised patient
 PCV 15 ml/kg at rate of 4-5 ml/kg/hour
Patient/ parent education
 Iron deficiency anaemia occurs generally due to dietary deficiency of iron. Once the diet is
modified, the patient should stick to that diet.
 Iron should be taken between meals and never with tea or milk
 Intake of iron usually causes harmless black discolouration of teeth and stools. The teeth
discolouration can be prevented by rinsing the mouth with water after doses."
MEGALOBLASTIC ANEMIA,"treatment
 Folic acid Deficiency- Oral folic acid - <6 months of age: 15 mcg/kg for 3 months
7 months –13 year: 1 mg for 3 weeks followed by 0.1-0.5 mg for next 3 months
 Vitamin B Deficiency
12
- Oral/sublingual vitamin B12
500-1000 mcg/day for 4-6 weeks
25-50 mcg/day for next 3 months
- Parenteral vitamin B12
100 mcg IM for 2 weeks
100-250 mcg/day IM till complete correction

PROTEIN ENERGY MALNUTRITION,"Treatment
Mild to moderate undernutrition
 Domiciliary treatment of malnourished children is economical, offers in-built advantage of
practical health education, and is associated with minimal recurrence risk.
 The parents are advised to increase the food intake of the child, adequate amount of calories
and protein in the diet, prepared from the locally available, inexpensive foods.
 Keep the child under surveillance by using a growth chart and effort should be made that he
does not slip down to severe malnutrition.
Severe malnutrition
 Initial treatment involves managing complications. The aim is to treat complications and
stabilize the child.
 Severely wasted children and those with oedema need hospitalization. Other indications for
admission in an undernourished child are severe dehydration, severe diarrhoea, hypothermia,
shock, systemic infection, jaundice, bleeding, age less than one year, or persistent loss of
appetite.
 Those with severe stunting alone may be managed in the community.
"
NUTRITIONAL RICKETS,"treatment
 Encourage the child to play outdoors/ increase exposure to sunlight.
 Enhance dietary sources of vitamin D -dairy products, egg and fish liver oil.
Pharmacological treatment

Pediatric Conditions
 Vitamin D 600,000 IU stat oral or IM (if patient is sick due to intercurrent infection).
 Repeat X-ray wrist after 4 weeks. If the response is positive, i.e. healing line of rickets is
seen on X-ray, continue oral vitamin D 400 IU/ day.
 If no response to therapy after 4 weeks"
PRIMARY NOCTURNAL ENURESIS,"treatment (effective in 30% cases)
 Rule out organic causes. Restrict fluid intake in the evening. Bladder exercises:
- hold urine as long as possible during the day.
- practice repeated starting and stopping the stream at the toilet bowl.
 Practice getting up from bed and going to the bathroom at bedtime before sleep.
380
Pediatric Conditions
Pharmacological treatment
 Indicated only in children > 6 years where sufficient trial of non-pharmacological
management has failed.
 Tab. imipramine: 6-8 year (25 mg), 9-12 year (50 mg), >12 year (75 mg) once a day at
bedtime. Or desmopressin acetate (nasal spray, 10 mcg per spray): Start with 10 mcg
given at bedtime daily and increase gradually by 10 mcg/per week to a maximum of 40
mcg per day. If effective, it should be used or 3-6 months.
"
ACUTE BRONCHIOLITIS,"treatment
For associated nasal block normal saline drops in both nostrils as and when required,
especially before feeds, and use of home remedies (ginger, honey, tulsi) for control of cough
and plenty of liquids orally. To be nursed in comfortable environment.
Pharmacological treatment
 Adequate hydration and oxygenation (humidified O2) remain the backbone of treatment.
 Treatment of mild disease (ambulatory treatment at home) - No antibiotics, Syr. paracetamol
10-15 mg/kg 4-6 hourly for fever.
 If patient shows overall improvement with no evidence of chest indrawing, cyanosis,
difficulty in feeding continue treatment as above. If there is partial improvement patient
should be called again after 2 days or earlier if patient deteriorates for reassessment.
 Hospitalize immediately if any of the following develop: chest indrawing, poor feeding,
cyanosis, altered sensorium and convulsions and managed as severe disease.
 If there is no improvement or deterioration at any time during the illness, the patient should
be managed as severe disease.
 Treatment of the severe disease (needs hospitalization for management) - oxygen
administration by oxygen hood or nasal catheter and intravenous fluids if child is not able to
feed.
 Adrenaline inhalation (injectable form) 0.3 mg/kg by nebulizer after dissolving the solution
in 3 ml saline; can be repeated every 4-6 hourly as required. (No role of antibiotics, steroids,
ribavirine inhalation in uncomplicated patients).
 If adrenaline not available, salbutamol inhalation (0.15 mg/kg dissolved in 3 ml soln.) may be
tried and continued if response observed.
 Syr. paracetamol 10-15 mg/kg dose may be given 4-6 hourly.
 Do not use sedatives.
 Monitor improvement in respiratory rate, lower chest indrawing, difficulty in feeding,
excessive crying, cyanosis and oxygen saturation, if available, every 4-6 hours till there is
significant improvement. If child does not improve/deteriorate look for underlying heart
disease i.e., myocarditis/congenital heart disease and get an X-ray chest and look for massive
collapse of lung/infection/pneumothorax etc. and manage accordingly.
Patient education
 Mother should be educated about the signs of pneumonia i.e., rapid respiratory rate, chest
indrawing, difficulty in feeding.
 Mother should be educated about identification of danger signals in a child suffering from
pneumonia and report immediately to the health care facility.
 Inhaled systemic steroids have not been recommended for the treatment of acute
bronchiolitis.

Correct faulty sterilization technique of feedingbottle; best to avoid bottle feeding.
Pharmacological treatment
 Clotrimazole 1% cream, gel or lotion, oral application 3-4 times/day after feeding for 5-
7days (or 1-2 days beyond recovery) Or miconazole gel 25 mg 4 times a day for 5-7
days. Or gentian violet 1% aqueous solution 1-2 times a day, for 5-7 days (can stain
tissues and clothes).
 In resistant/chronic cases (patients with major underlying disease) Tab. fluconazole 3-6
mg/kg once daily for 5-7 days. Or Tab. ketoconazole 3-6 mg/kg once daily for 5-7 days.
 In resistant recurrent/chronic thrush in a child with no obvious predisposing factor/ source
of infection, look for underlying endocrinopathy, immune disorder, AIDS and
malnutrition.
Patient education
 Emphasize on bottle hygiene, care/hygiene of the nipple and treatment of vaginal
candidiasis in expectant mother.
384
Pediatric Conditions"
CONSTIPATION,"treatment
 Dietary modification: Ensure adequate fluid intake in diet. In infants, breast milk should
continue as it is less likely to be constipating than cow's milk, can add extra sugar in
cow's milk if child is not breast-fed.
 Add fiber by cereals (wheat bran, oat), pulses, vegetables, salads and fruits and isabgol.
 Toilet training to achieve regular evacuation. Child is instructed to use bathroom after
breakfast or dinner, to take advantage of meal stimulated increase in colonic motility.
 Maintain calendar to record evacuations.
 Positive reinforcement (reward/appreciation) for successful toileting (no punishment for
failure).
Pharmacological treatment
 Agarol or lactulose in infants 2.5-10 ml/day; children 40-90 ml/day in 3-4
divided doses. Or mineral oil (liquid paraffin) 5-15 ml/kg/day Or milk of magnesia 0.5-3
ml/kg/day. Dose is titrated to produce at least one stool/day.
 Enemas may be used in severe cases where sufficient trial of medical therapy
has failed. To empty the bowel of faecoliths, enemas may be required daily or on
alternate days for initial few days.
 In severe cases with faecal soiling, in the initial stages: bowel cleaning/ disimpaction may
be required with enemas 1-2/day or suppositories 1-2/day. In very severe cases with
multiple faecoliths, failed medical treatment, mental retardation etc., surgical
disimpaction may be done.
 If a surgical cause is suspected patient should be investigated and treated accordingly.
The main objective of medical management is to dislodge faecal mass, overcome
withholding behaviour and promote regular bowel habits.
385
Pediatric Conditions
Patient education
 Importance of dietary modifications should be explained. Treatment should not be
abandoned early after recovery.
 Bowel training should have only positive reinforcements. Negative reinforcement should
be avoided at all costs."
ACUTE DIARRHOEA,"treatment
Blood urea, All 3 investigations in moderate to severe dehydration, SE in
S. electrolytes (SE) and persistent vomiting or signs of dyselectrolytaemia, ABG in
arterial blood gas (ABG) respiratory distress and no chest signs and sepsis (correct it
only if pH <7.25).
Infection screening by Fever persisting >72 hours, PEM > grade III or age <3
TLC, DLC, band cell count, months.
ESR and CRP
Blood culture Suspected sepsis, Before starting antibiotics.
Chest X-ray, CSF and others As and when required
Stool culture No role
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Maintain hydration by home available fluids (HAF) in place of or along with ORS. These
are rice, kanji, butter milk, dal soup, coconut water or weak tea etc. Soft drinks,
sweetened fruit drinks and tea are unsuitable and could be potentially dangerous.
386
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintain nutrition: continue breast feeding. Continue normal light diet e.g. khichri, dalia,
banana or mashed dal etc. Do not dilute or stop milk as there is not much role of lactose
intolerance or milk protein allergy. Give extra food during recovery.
Pharmacological treatment
 Low osmolarity oral rehydration solution (ORS) is used in some dehydration 75 ml/kg in
4 hours under observation.
 After 4 hours if dehydration is corrected, or if child was not dehydrated at presentation,
send home with instructions to give ORS in 2:1 dilution as accepted by the child. Asked
to report back if vomiting persists or urine is not passed for >8 hours. As a rough
guideline 10 ml/kg of ORS may be added for each large stool.
 If dehydration is not corrected after 4 hours, same amount of ORS may be repeated in
next 4 hours and if dehydration is corrected, send the patient home. If dehydration does
not improve in 8 hours or if it worsens, abandon oral rehydration therapy (ORT) and give
IV fluids.
 Zinc ORS is not superior to supplementation of zinc separately, in malnourished children
with diarrhoea.
 Principles of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)
- Give in small sips.
- Vomiting is not a contraindication unless persistent.
- Contraindicated in altered sensorium or paralytic ileus.
- Stop as soon as diarrhoea stops.
 IV fluid therapy in case of severe dehydration or shock or contraindications or
failure of ORT. N/2 saline is given over 8 hours (1:100 ml KG after child passes
urine), as follows:
- Some dehydration-75 ml/kg.
- Severe dehydration-100 ml/kg (half in first 2-3 hours)
- Shock- push 20 ml/kg of Ringer's lactate or normal saline over 15 minutes and can repeat
twice more if shock persists use central venous pressure monitoring for further
management if shock present after pushing 60 ml/kg.
 Specific therapyis indicated -Frank blood and mucus in the stool or >10 pus cells/HPF
- Syr. ciprofloxacin 15-20 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses (Shigella strains are largely
resistant to ampicillin and cotrimoxazole) for 5 days
Giardiasis (only if trophozoites are seen on stool microscopy)
- Syr. metronidazole 15 mg/kg/day in 3 divided doses for 5 days Or
- Syr. tinidazole 50 mg/kg/day single dose (max. 2 g)
Cholera (suspect in any child with severe watery diarrhoea)
Mainstay of treatment is fluid therapy and following antibiotic may be used to prevent
spread: Syr. doxycycline 5 mg/kg (max 200 mg) in single dose. Or Syr. furazolidone 5
mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses for 3 days. Or Syr. cotrimoxazole (TMP) 8 mg/kg/day in 2
divided doses for 5 days. Or Syr. erythromycin 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days.
387
Pediatric Conditions
 Severe infections to be treated by appropriate parenteral antibiotics.
 There is not much role of antiemetics in a child with vomiting. Rule out meningitis, URI
and dyselectrolytaemia and give ORS in sips. If vomiting persists give intravenous fluids.
However, occasionally 1 or 2 doses of metoclopramide (0.5 mg/kg) or domperidone (0.5
mg/kg) may be tried before giving intravenous fluids. Binding agents e.g., Kaolin pectin
etc. are not useful.
 Following drugs are contraindicated,
- Antimotility agents e.g. diphenoxylate, atropine etc. and antisecretory agents e.g.,
loperamide, salicylates etc.
 Keep record of vitals e.g. pulse, BP, capillary filling time (CFT), respiratory rate (1
hourly) and temperature (6 hourly). Monitor for improvement or worsening of signs of
dehydration. Record urine output and stool frequency and consistency.
 Modifications or step up treatment
- Admit if PEM grade III or age <3 months (as higher chances of complications e.g. shock,
hypoglycaemia etc.), associated severe systemic infections e.g. septicaemia, meningitis or
pneumonia.
- Investigate for lactose intolerance, incipient infections e.g., Urinary tract infection (UTI)
or rare gut organisms, if diarrhoea persists for >7 days.
- Exclude parenchymal renal failure, if child has not passed urine after hydration. Give a
fluid challenge (20 ml/kg of normal saline) followed by frusemide injection (1-2 mg/kg).
If urine is still not passed then parenchymal renal failure considered and managed
accordingly.
Patient education
 Inform natural course of diarrhoea to avoid dissatisfaction and ORS only prevents
dehydration i.e. purge rate and consistency usually improves by 3-7 days
 Explain the complications in diarrhoea are because of dehydration and thus ORS is the
mainstay of therapy. Explain preparation of ORS and method of administration.
Nutritional advice as mentioned earlier in non-pharmacological section. Education about
food and water hygiene."
ACUTE VIRAL HEPATITIS,"treatment
 Rest if the patient feels exhausted or fatigued (forced rest does not help and does not
shorten the time to recovery).
 Regular small frequent meals with high caloric content. High carbohydrate diets are
acceptable but should be hygienic. Traditionally sugarcane juice is used as home therapy
though it has no established benefit. Maintain adequate hydration in case of vomiting and
avoid fatty meals.
Pharmacological treatment
 There is no specific treatment for simple acute viral hepatitis. Uncomplicated cases can be
treated at home. If patient has frequent vomiting, oral metoclopramide 0.1 mg/kg/dose
can be given as and when required but not to be repeated before 6 hours.
 Usually fever abates after jaundice appears. Occasionally if the situation requires,
paracetamol may be used sparingly.
 Persistent high grade fever suggests alternative diagnosis. Hospitalization required only in
clinically severe illness e.g. alteration in sleep pattern, altered behaviour, abnormal
movements, persistent vomiting, dehydration, decreased urinary output, bleeding from
any site or any other complication.
Patient education
 Continue breast feeding or other regular feeding. Observe carefully for any danger signs
listed above. Usually a self limiting disease and fever subsides after the jaundice is
evident clinically. Most patients start recovering in 7-14 days time. Total duration of
illness is 3 weeks.
 Hepatitis A and B are two different diseases. Getting your child vaccinated with hepatitis
B vaccine will not protect you against Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A spreads through
contaminated food and water and close person to person contact.
 Raw or insufficiently cooked food (fruits, vegetables, salads) or cooked food handled by
an infected individual can be the source of hepatitis A infection."

as well as immune compromised individual. Reactivation disease results in herpes
zoster or shingles.
389
Pediatric Conditions
Itching is bothersome and scratching effect may be minimized by making the patient wear
mittens. Daily change of clothes and good personal hygiene may decrease the risk of
secondary infection.
Pharmacological treatment
 For management of fever: Aspirin and other salicylates are contraindicated due to risk of
Reye's syndrome and should not be used.
 Local anti-pruritic agents like calamine lotion may alleviate itching. If itching is not
relieved with above. Tab. pheniramine 25 mg 2 times a day Or Tab. cetirizine: in
children (2-6 years) 5 mg; (>6 years) 10 mg once a day.
 In case of immuno-compromised children on long term treatment with steroids, anti-
cancer drugs or other immunosupressive therapy, HIV positive patients, children older
than 12 years of age, those with chronic cutaneous or pulmonary disorders who are at
increased risk of severe disease, oral acyclovir if started within few hours (<24 h) of the
onset of rash may decrease the duration, magnitude of fever as well as the number of skin
lesions.
 Tab. acyclovir 20 mg/kg/ day is given 6 hourly for 5 days. In case the patient is severely
immuno-compromised or severe disease in adults, Inj. acyclovir should be started as soon
as possible in all cases at the dose of 10 mg/kg 8 hourly IV for 7 days.
Assessment of response to therapy
 Most cases will stop having fever after the initial 3-4 days when new crops of vesicle stop
appearing. The vesicles normally heal by scabbing in about a week's time. Persistence of
fevermay suggest secondary infection.
Patient education
 The disease is self limiting in healthy children. Child should be excluded from day care or
school till after 6th day of the rash or till scabs are formed.
 Do not uses “over the counter” fever medicines as they may contain aspirin or other
salicylates.
 An expensive but potent vaccine is available for protection against the disease and can be
recommended only for those at risk of severe form of the disease and are
immunocompetent.
 Post exposure prophylaxis with Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin (VZIG, specific
immunoglobulin) is recommended for the contacts that are severely immunocompromised
or pregnant (particularly in the first trimester).

Pediatric Conditions"
MEASLES,"treatment
 Isolate from others particularly unimmunized children for at least four days after the
appearance of the rash.
 Bed rest and cold sponging may be required for febrile patients.
 Small frequent feeds and plenty of oral fluids should be continued.
Pharmacological treatment
No specific antiviral treatment is available. Fever is managed with oral paracetamol.
Treatment of other co-existing problems
 Inj. vitamin A 100,000 IU or high dose oil based oral preparation (50,000 IU) is given IM
for 2 consecutive days. A third dose may be given 4 weeks later particularly if there are
manifesting signs of vitamin A deficiency.
 Treat appropriately secondary bacterial infection like bronchopneumonia and or
gastrointestinal infection.
Patient education
 The disease leads to marked anorexia and also often precipitates protein energy
malnutrition (PEM) and other deficiencies. Regular frequent feeds must continue. Extra
meal should be added during convalescence.
 The disease usually lasts 10-12 days and the maximum risk of infectivity is 5 days prior
to and 4 days after the appearance of rash. The rash usually heals by desquamation and
often leaves some hyperpigmented stains on the body which disappears over weeks
subsequently.
 The parents must report to the hospital in case the child develops any of the following
warning signs:
- Stiff neck, convulsions (seizures), extreme drowsiness, loss of consciousness or altered
behaviour.
- Rapid and or laboured breathing, difficulty in feeding, cyanosis.
- Significant dehydration as evident by sunken eyes or fontanelles, loss of skin turgor,
dryness of tongue or lack of tears etc.
- Blood in stools.
391
Pediatric Conditions
 Vaccination against measles is recommended at 7- 9 months of life and a subsequent
booster with measles or MMR is mandated at 15 months of age particularly if the primary
immunization was done at less than 9 months of age. There is no role of giving measles
vaccination to a child who has already suffered from the disease.
 Unimmunized child below 5 year in contact with the patient may be immunized. Measles
vaccine, if used early, can prevent or decrease the severity of the disease in the secondary
contacts."
MUMPS,"treatment
 Child should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids. Water, decaffeinated soft drinks and
tea are better tolerated than acidic fruit juices (like orange juice, grape fruit juice or
lemonade) that make parotid pain worse.
 Either warm or cold packs - whichever feels better- may be used to sooth the swollen
parotid glands.
Pharmacological treatment
 Most cases are treated symptomatically on OPD basis.
 Fever treated using non aspirin fever medications such as paracetamol (10-15 mg/kg/day
SOS or every 4-6 hours). These medicines will also help relieve pain in the swollen
parotid glands. (caution: aspirin is contraindicated in children with viral illnesses due to
risk of Reye's syndrome).
 Being a viral illness, antibiotics have no role. There is no specific therapy available.
 Patients with abdominal pain, testicular swellings or signs of raised intracranial tension
need to be admitted in the hospital.
Patient education
 Parents should be explained warning signs e.g. in boys, parents are told to watch for high
fever, with pain and swelling of the testicles.
392
Pediatric Conditions
 Watch for abdominal pain that can mean involvement of the pancreas in either sex, or
involvement of the ovaries in girls.
 Severe headache, stiff neck, convulsions (seizures), extreme drowsiness etc suggest CNS
involvement and need for admission to a tertiary level center.
 Recurrence of high grade fever (above 101°F/38.3°C) often heralds onset of the above
complication and can be used as an early"
ACUTE FLACCID PARALYSIS,"Treatment for acute polio cases
All cases should be treated as below except patients with isolated single lower limb
involvement and reporting after 4 days of onset of paralysis and currently not progressing for
more than 48 hours.
Non-pharmacological treatment
 Complete bed rest and correct positioning of the affected limbs in the optimal position as
follows: Hip - slight flexion, knee - 5 degrees flexion, foot - 90 degrees with support
against the soles. Both legs should be supported from the lateral sides with pillows or
rolled towels or salt/sand packs to prevent rotation.
 When pain subsides, passive movements of the joints for about 10 minutes, 2-3 times a
day.
 Warm water fomentation using hot packs with soaked towels wrapped around the affected
parts for about 10 minutes, 2-3 times a day help in relieving pain. If transient urinary
retention occurs, alternate hot and cold compresses over the suprapubic region.
Caution: No massage or intramuscular injections as it may further precipitate paralysis.
Watch for progression, particularly for the involvement of the respiratory muscles.

Pediatric Conditions
Pharmacological treatment
There is no specific drug therapy for polio. For fever and pain, use paracetamol or ibuprofen."
PERTUSSIS (WHOOPING COUGH),"treatment
 Syr./Tab. erythromycin, 40-50 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses orally for 14 days initiated
early in the coryzal phase of the disease i.e. first 14 days of the illness may shorten the
course of whooping cough, which otherwise may last for weeks or months. Once the
paroxysms start, no antimicrobial have any benefit except for eradication of any
secondary pulmonary infection.
 In patients with severe coughing paroxysms salbutamol 1-2 mg/kg/ day in 3-4 divided
doses for a week or so may be tried.
 Severe cases particularly those <6 months of age and those with respiratory distress need
to be admitted for intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy.
Supportive therapy
 Oxygen therapy is required in severe cases with respiratory distress. Hydration should be
maintained with intravenous or oral fluids in adequate amounts (cough suppressants are
usually not helpful).
Patient education
 To continue feeding during the prolonged period of cough, adequate hydration and
nutrition to prevent onset of malnutrition.
394
Pediatric Conditions
 Antibiotic therapy must be continued for at least 14 days to prevent relapse of the disease,
even if they may not be providing any relief in the symptoms. All contacts below 7 years
of age must be given erythromycin for 14 days.
 Contact the doctor immediately if the patient develops listlessness, apnoea or seizures.
This is particularly more common in infants below 6 months.
 Immunization against pertussis is as triple antigen Diphtheria Pertussis Tetanus (DPT)
and 3 primary doses are routinely advised for all infants followed by a booster after 1.5
years and 4.5 years after the primary immunization."
CARDIAC FAILURE,"treatment
 Restricted activity and bed rest with upright posture depending on cardiac reserve.
 In severe CHF, dietary modifications in infants by increasing calories per feed. Breast-
feed supplementation, naso-gastric feed to avoid the exertion of active feeding.
 No added salt in diet and fluid restriction. Cold sponging in case of fever.
Pharmacological treatment
Identify and treat the underlying cause. Algorithm for treatment is shown in figure.
 Elixir/Tab. digoxin (Elixir 0.25 mg/5 ml, Tab. 0.25 mg)
Method of digitalization: 0.5 x digitalization dose initially, 0.25 x digitalizing dose 8 and 16
hours later.
Digitalizing dose: Newborn = IV, IM: 0.010 - 0.030 mg/kg divided or orally: 0.040 mg/kg
divided in fractions.
Infants = IV, IM 0.030 - 0.040 mg/kg or orally 0.050 mg/kg in fractions.
Children = IV, IM, PO: 0.010 -0.015 mg/kg in fractions.
395
Pediatric Conditions
 Maintenance dosage 24 hours after 1st fraction of digitalizing dose. Newborn = PO: 0.005
- 0.010 mg/kg/24 hours, divided every 12 hours. In infants and children orally 0.002 -
0.005 mg/kg/24 hours divided every 12 hours. (Caution: Avoid hypokalaemia during
therapy with digoxin)
 Tab. furosemide 1-2 mg/kg every 12 hourly (may need K supplement).
Or Tab. chlorothiazide 20-50 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses. Or Tab. spironolactone 1-3
mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses.
 In cases with regurgitant cardiac lesions like severe MR where reduction
in after load is required, Tab. captopril 0.1-0.2 mg kg/dose 8-12 hourly (maximum 4
mg/kg/day). Or Tab. enalapril 0.08-0.5 mg/kg/dose 12-24 hourly (maximum 1 mg/kg/
day).
 Patients with hypotension and low cardiac output should be referred to a higher center for
Inj. dopamine infusion (40 mg/ml) 2-20 mcg/kg/min prepared in normal saline or 5%
dextrose. Hypovolaemia should be corrected before infusion is started and BP is
monitored during the infusion. Or Inj. dobutamine infusion (250 mg/5 ml) 2- 20
mcg/kg/min. Both the drugs can be used simultaneously to have added response.
Patient education
 Decreased salt intake, sufficient rest and adequate sleep must be emphasized. Strict bed
rest is necessary only in severe cases. Semi-upright position during sleep may make the
patient more comfortable.

DIABETES MELLITUS,"treatment
 Diet:
- Regularity of eating pattern is very important so that diet and insulin dosing is
synchronized.
- General nutritional guidelines are followed. Calorie mixture should have 55%
carbohydrates, 30% fat and 15% proteins.
- Avoid carbohydrate with refined sugars to prevent metabolic swings. Carbonated drinks
should be of sugar free variety.
- Fats derived from animal sources to be reduced and should be replaced by fats of
vegetable origin.
- Calorie intake should be split as 20% breakfast, 20% lunch, 30% dinner and 10% each for
3 snacks at mid morning, mid afternoon and evening.
 Physical activity and fitness:
- Usual exercises advised to diabetic children and adolescents include vigorous walking,
jogging, swimming, tennis etc.
397
Pediatric Conditions
- Though, diabetics can undertake any exercise, but unusual exercise may require modification
in insulin dosing. For the schedule day of unusual exercise, insulin dose may be reduced by
10-15%.
Pharmacological treatment
 Initial therapy:
Treatment is initiated in the hospital with fast acting (regular) insulin. At the onset of DM
(or after recovery from DKA) the dose of insulin is 0.5-1.0 unit/kg/day.
Inj. Regular insulin 0.1-0.25 units/kg subcutaneous injections are given 6-8 hourly before
meals.
- Simultaneous blood glucose level monitoring is done. One to two days therapy is required
to find out total daily insulin requirement. Once the patient stabilizes on 6 hourly insulin
injections, the patient is switched over to ""2 daily injections"" schedule.
- In ""2 daily injections"" schedule, the insulin is administered as follows:
Combinations of intermediate acting (usually lente) insulin and fast acting (regular)
insulin in the ratio of 2-3:1. Two third of total daily -dose is injected before breakfast and
one third before dinner. Each injection has combination of both types of insulin e.g., total
dose of insulin is 30 units -20 units (14 units lente and 6 units regular) are injected before
breakfast and 10 units (6 units lente and 4 units regular) are injected before dinner.
- Blood glucose levels are monitored before each meal and the dose of insulin adjusted
accordingly. Blood glucose levels should ideally be 80 mg/dl fasting and 140 mg/dl after
meals (acceptable range between 80 -240 mg/dl). Early morning 3 AM blood glucose
level should be more than 70 mg/dl.
 Modification in the insulin doses:
- Modification in the insulin doses will be required depending upon the blood glucose
levels. Any increase or decrease in insulin dose is by 10 - 15% (generally not more than 6
units).
- After initial stabilization, newly diagnosed cases may have gradual decline in insulin
requirement even upto 0.5 units/kg/day. This may persist for several weeks to several
months.
- Decrease total dose of insulin by 10% at the time of discharge from hospital as the
increased activity at home will decrease the insulin requirement.
 Assessment of diabetic control or response to therapy
- Blood glucose estimation should be done before each meal and at bed time in the first few
weeks afterdiagnosis. After stabilization, it can be reduced to twice a week.
- Periodically blood glucose estimation at 3-4 AM is required to detect early morning
hypoglycaemia.
- Urine for sugar is also monitored initially 3-4 times daily before meals. Urine for ketones
once daily should be done.
398
Pediatric Conditions
- Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA estimation-once every 3 months. - levels of 6-9%
1c
represent very good control of diabetes, 9 -12% show fair control and above 12%
represent poor control.
- Serum lipids -cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, triglycerides and urine for protein should
be done once every year. Serum cholesterol should be less than 200 mg/dl, LDL less than
130 mg/dl and triglycerides less than 140 mg/dl.
- Thyroid function tests should be done once every year to detect concomitant
hypothyroidism.
Patient education
 Patient/parents should be taught self diabetic care which should include: Technique of
measuring insulin in the syringe. Importance of drawing insulin always in the same
sequence (usually regular insulin first) so that same type of insulin is left over in the dead
space of the syringe. Explain technique of subcutaneous injections and importance of
rotating the injection sites -arms, thighs (upper and lower), buttocks and abdomen.
 Adherence to diet and regular exercise. Recognizing the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and
its home management."
HYPOTHYROIDISM,"treatment
 Thyroxin treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed by thyroid
function tests (preferablythe same day as the evaluation).
 There remains some controversy regarding the initial starting dose of thyroxin and how
quickly the Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should be normalized. A recommended
starting dose is approximately 10-15 mcg/kg/day.
 The initial dose for first 7 days may be on the higher end (14 mcg/kg/day) and then reduced
to lower level (10 mcg/kg/day) and then tapered to 5-7 mcg/kg/day by 1st year.

Assessment of response
 Early response is evident in initial few weeks with symptomatic improvement in
alertness, relief of constipation, improvement in appetite and feeding. Increased linear
growth and osseous maturation is seen over next few months.
 The child should be followed clinically every month for 6 months, 3 monthly till 2 years
and thereafter once to twice every year. Recurrence of symptoms such as lethargy,
constipation and weight gain suggest under treatment and diarrhoea, palpitations,
increased appetite and weight loss suggest overdosing. Periodic check on thyroid
function tests is needed (6 monthly or so). Serum T4 level should be maintained in upper
normal range and TSH levels suppressed to normal.
 After few months of starting therapy, sometimes features suggestive of raised intracranial
tension such as headache and vomiting may appear. The patient should be immediately
admitted and treated.
Patient education
 Need for life long administration of the drug. Regular"
URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI),"management) or septicaemia
- Recurrent UTI - Indication of bladder anomaly: severe constipation, urinary dribbling,
poor urinary stream, straining, palpable bladder, renal disease: stunting, raised
creatinine, hypertension, flank mass
Pharmacological treatment
 Patients less than 3 months of age, systemically toxic with high fever, loin pain and
vomiting, and with underlying structural abnormality of urinary tract, are better treated as
inpatients and with parenteral antibiotics. All other patients can be treated as outpatients
with oral antibiotics.
 The initial antibiotic choice should be guided by local culture and sensitivity report
return. The duration of therapy is 10-14 days for infants and children with complicated
UTI, and 7-10 days for uncomplicated UTI. Adolescents with cystitis may be treated
with shorter duration antibiotics. Hydration must be maintained with oral or IV fluids as
required.
 Analgesics and antipyretics are used as per necessity.
 Patients with obstructive uropathies may need urgent drainage without which resolution
of UTI may be difficult.
 Maintain adequate hydration and encourage liberal fluid intake to alleviate dysuria. The
antibiotics suggested for the treatment of UTI is as follows:

Monitoring and"
POSTSTREPTOCOCCAL ACUTE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS (AGN),"Treatment
 Monitoring of fluid intake, output, blood pressure, urea, creatinine and electrolytes
required on regular basis. Complete blood count, Anti Streptolysin O Titre (ASOT), C3,
renal ultrasound should be performed at presentation.
 Fluid restriction to urine output and insensible losses.
 Inj.Procaine penicillin 4 lac units once daily if evidence of sore throat or skin infection.
 Potassium restriction
 Treatment of complications such as hyperkalemia, hypertension and fluid overload. If
conservative management of these complications is not sufficient for control, early
dialysis should be initiated.
 Treatment of acute hyperkalemia
1 Restrict K intake
2 Transient reversal of cardiotoxicity with calcium gluconate(10%) 1ml/kg in distilled
water, slow IV infusion
3 Temporary reduction of potassium in extracellular fluid with:
Nebulised salbutamol
Sodium Bicarbonate : 1-2 mmol/kg
Glucose (0.5g/kg) + insulin (0.1U/kg) infusion
4 Removal of potassium from the body by:
Frusemide (1-2 mg/kg)
Potassium exchange resins(1g/kg/day)

Patient education
Parents should be explained the natural course. More than 95% recover within 2 – 4 weeks.
Only a few patients may end up with chronic renal insufficiency.
403
Pediatric Conditions"
NEPHROTIC SYNDROME,"management are urine analysis, blood
counts, S. cholesterol, S. proteins, blood urea, S.creatinine, urine culture, X-ray chest,
Mantoux, HBsAg.
Pharmacological treatment
Definitions useful for guiding treatment are as follows:
- Remission:Urine albumin nil or trace (or proteinuria <4 mg/m2/h) for 3 consecutive days.
- Relapse: Urine albumin 3+ or 4+ (or proteinuria >40 mg/m2/h) for 3 consecutive days
having been in remission previously.
- Frequent relapses: Two or more relapses in six months of initial response, or more than
three relapses in any twelve months.
- Steroid dependence: Two consecutive relapses when on alternate day steroids or within
14 days of its discontinuation.
- Steroid resistance: Absence of remission despite therapy with 4 weeks of daily
prednisolone in a dose of 2 mg/kg per day
 Steroid Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome (SSNS)
- The first episode: Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day (or 60 mg/m2/day) after food for 6 weeks,
followed by 1.5 mg/kg/alternate day (or 40 mg/m2/alternate day) for 6 weeks.
- Infrequent relapses: Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day until remission followed by 1.5
mg/kg/day for 4 weeks.
- Frequent relapses and steroid dependant (SDNS): the following options are used
successively.
- Prednisolone for achievement of remission followed by maintenance of a low dose (<than
0.5 mg/kg) on alternate day basis for 12-18 months.
- Levamisole 2.5 mg/kg/alternate day for 6 to 24 months. Monitoring of CBC is required 1-
2 monthly.
- Cyclophosphamide (CP) 2-3 mg/kg/day for 2-3 months to achieve a cumulative dose of
168 mg/kg. CBC monitoring is required 1-2 weekly.
- Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 20-30 mg/kg/day
- Tacrolimus (TAC) 0/1-0.2 mg/kg/day
404
Pediatric Conditions
- Cyclosporine A (CSA) 3-5 mg/kg day
- Rituximab (RTX) is a relatively new and potent therapy which is used only rarely for
extremely difficult cases that does not respond to other options.
- Note: A renal biopsy is advised before starting TAC or CSA. Immuno-suppressive
therapy requires supervision by paediatric nephrologist and monitoring of hemograms
(for all), liver function (MMF and TAC) and glucose and magnesium levels (TAC), renal
function (TAC and CSA) and drug levels (MMF, TAC, CSA).
Figure 2. Treatment of steroid sensitive nephritic syndrome without hypertension,
hematuria and azotemia
Supportive Treatment
 Detect and treat infections rapidly.
 Mobilize the patient early
 Antacids, H2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors are often prescribed along with
steroids but they are no definite evidence to support this in patients who do not have any
symptoms of gastritis.
 Calcium and vitamin D supplements may be used to reduce osteopenic effects of steroids,
however definitive evidence and guidelines are not yet available.
 Diet: Avoid excessive salt intake in edematous patient. A balanced diet with less than
30% fats and at least 2 gm/kg/day protein is advised.
 Edema should be treated cautiously with diuretics while closely monitoring hypovolemia
and renal function.
 Hypovolemia should be detected rapidly and treated by fluids and colloids.
 Patients who are chronically nephritic may have hyperlipidemia which is managed by diet
and if persistent, with statins.
 Hypertension should be controlled and BP maintained below 90th percentile of age.
405
Pediatric Conditions
 Complete immunization when the patient is in remission. Vaccinate for varicella and
pneumococcus. Avoid live vaccines during immunosuppressive therapy and for 3 months
after cessation.
 Stress dose of hydrocortisone (2-4 mg/kg/day) should be used in patients who have
received high dose steroids for 2 weeks or more in the past year, when they present with
serious infections or other critical illnesses, or if undergoing major surgery."
FEBRILE SEIZURES,"treatment
Clear the airway, semi-prone lateral position and oxygen therapy.
Pharmacological treatment
Most febrile seizures are brief and would be over by the time a child is brought to the doctor
or health facility. Careful search for the cause of fever and treat fever.
 In cases presenting with seizures, the mainstay of management is prompt administration
of anticonvulsants.
 The best drug is diazepam in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg by slow intravenous or rectal route. It
can be repeated if seizures do not subside (per rectal dose may be given up to 0.5
mg/kg/dose). Lorazepam can be used as an alternative.
Intermittent prophylaxis (during febrile illness)
Tab/Syr. diazepam 0.3 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours (1 mg/kg/day) for 2-3 days of febrile
illness, started on the day of onset of fever. Dose can be adjusted if over sedation or ataxia
noted.
Continuous prophylaxis
Phenytoin and carbamazepine are ineffective for prophylaxis and phenobarbitone has serious
effects on cognitive function. Sodium valproate is effective but potential risk does not justify
its use.
Patient education( parents/care taker)
 Assure the benign nature of the disease with no neurological deficit or mental retardation
as a result of simple febrile seizure. Teach to control of fever and to give diazepam per
rectally at home.
 Routine immunization as per schedule should be followed. After DPT vaccination, oral
paracetamol 15 mg/kg/dose every 6 h for 2 or 3 days and similarly, after measles
vaccination, oral paracetamol in the same dose started on the 4th day from the day of
vaccination and given for 3 to 4 days to avoid precipitation of febrile seizures.
ACUTE PYOGENIC MENINGITIS (CSF or clinically proven)
Acute meningitis is an acute inflammatory process involving brain tissue, due to infectious
causes. The common aetiological agents are viruses and bacteria. Children of any age may be
affected.
Salient features
 Fever, headache, vomiting, irritability, altered state of consciousness, signs of
meningeal irritation and seizures. CSF examination differentiates the viral from
bacterial causes.

Supportive treatment is the mainstay of therapy and is started immediately.
 Maintain airway, breathing and circulation.
 Control seizures with IV injection of diazepam 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg stat followed by inj.
phenytoin 10 –20 mg/kg stat followed by 5 mg/kg/day in divided doses.
 Increased intracranial tension is treated by proper positioning of the patient with head
elevated at 15 – 30º position, fluid restriction to 2/3rd of maintenance, 20% mannitol 5
ml/kg over 10 –15 mins. followed by 3 ml/kg every 6 hours for 48 hours and then SOS
Or glycerine 1 ml/kg/day through feeding tube may be added if increased intracranial
tension persists.
 Fever is controlled as given in section of fever (do not give aspirin).
 The intravenous fluid is two thirds of the maintenance requirement initially.
 Feeding: Initially the patient is kept nil orally for the first 24 – 48 hours. Later on the
feeding is guided by the level of sensorium. Tube feeding is helpful for feedings as well
as giving medicines.
Specific Management
 Until a bacterial cause is excluded, parenteral antibiotic therapy should be administered.
The choice of antibiotics depends upon age of the patient and prevalence of organism in
the area.
Age 0-3 months
 Inj.cefotaxime 200 mg/kg/day IV in 4 divided doses for 14 days.
